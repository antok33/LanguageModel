V*UNK* of the sitting ( The sitting was closed at *UNK* ) *UNK* of Parliament : see Minutes *UNK* by the President *UNK* days ago in *UNK* , more people *UNK* at the hands of terrorists .
p2
aVWe share the *UNK* of the victims ' families , and hope that those responsible for these attacks will be found quickly and tried .
p3
aVThe European Parliament condemns and has always condemned acts of violence of this sort .
p4
aVToday *UNK* the *UNK* anniversary of the issue of the order by *UNK* to *UNK* over 20 000 *UNK* *UNK* *UNK* .
p5
aVThey were prisoners of war , and were being held *UNK* following the aggression of the *UNK* against Poland in September *UNK* .
p6
aVDuring the last parliamentary term , Members had the opportunity to watch the film *UNK* ' , which *UNK* the story of these events .
p7
aVLast Friday , it was *UNK* for the first time on Russian public television .
p8
aVFor the first time , the Prime Ministers of Poland and the Russian Federation are paying tribute to the victims of the crime in *UNK* together , today , 7 April .
p9
aVThis important step on the road to *UNK* reconciliation , and also on the road to reconciliation in the East , is also a signal to the whole of Europe and is the next stage of the reconciliation of the Eastern and Western parts of our continent , which we all want .
p10
aV( Applause ) I would also like to inform you that the European Commission will be represented by Mr *UNK* at today 's plenary sitting .
p11
aVMr *UNK* is unable to attend , today , for important family reasons .

p13
aV*UNK* attacks on religious minorities in *UNK* and in *UNK* The next item is the debate on the motion for a resolution on the recent attacks against religious minorities in *UNK* and *UNK* .
p14
aVauthor .
p15
aV- Mr President , in the week of *UNK* *UNK* Christmas , an attack took place killing and *UNK* 20 *UNK* *UNK* .
p16
aVAlthough the attack can be seen as a criminal act of individuals , various other *UNK* incidents require our ongoing focus on respect for all minorities in *UNK* .
p17
aV*UNK* and hatred can not be accepted in the name of religion .
p18
aVPeople have a universal right to freedom of religion as well as freedom from religion .
p19
aV*UNK* and religious diversity asks for a vigilant society that is able to reconcile differences in open debate , a society where people of any background or conviction know that their freedoms are guaranteed .
p20
aVAn open society can only be realised when the *UNK* of religion and state is implemented in the constitution and throughout the system of government .
p21
aVSecurity measures can not be the only means to manage a *UNK* society .
p22
aVYet state emergency laws have been in place in *UNK* for the past 28 years .
p23
aVA free debate is perhaps the most powerful *UNK* against extremism and violence .
p24
aVTherefore , freedom of expression , both online and *UNK* , can be seen as the *UNK* Government 's best tool to resolve *UNK* in society .
p25
aVIt is therefore very difficult to understand or accept that around 30 *UNK* , politicians and *UNK* were arrested by government forces while travelling to the southern *UNK* town of *UNK* *UNK* to express their *UNK* to the families of those killed during the *UNK* violence .
p26
aVThe *UNK* are a particularly *UNK* example of what has become a pattern of the *UNK* Government 's interference in citizens ' rights to freedom of expression .
p27
aV*UNK* is *UNK* wrong when people are treated like criminals merely for attempting to show sympathy and solidarity with fellow countrymen .
p28
aVIn too many cases , the argument of maintaining public order is *UNK* .
p29
aVSince 2008 , *UNK* have been unable to get an *UNK* *UNK* line , but the control is not total .
p30
aVNew rules are now in force , under which users of *UNK* have to pay for a connection , for which they need to provide an *UNK* address to have a *UNK* and a *UNK* sent .
p31
aVThis allows for active control of users by the government .
p32
aVMoreover , a draft law is under debate in the parliament about *UNK* regulation , providing for prison *UNK* for *UNK* of *UNK* content without government permission ' .
p33
aVYet the *UNK* Constitution says , *UNK* of expression or freedom of opinion is guaranteed .
p34
aVEvery individual has the right to express his opinion and to *UNK* it *UNK* or in writing or by *UNK* or by other means within the limits of the law ' .
p35
aV*UNK* and constructive criticism are the guarantee for the safety of the national structure .
p36
aVI urge the *UNK* Government to *UNK* from introducing emergency laws limiting fundamental freedoms in light of the *UNK* *UNK* present .
p37
aVAn adequate response to crimes committed in the name of religion is only appropriate .
p38
aVHowever , this should not be used as a reason to *UNK* the population as a whole , with laws limiting free speech and expression .
p39
aVOnly when fundamental freedoms are safeguarded by the Constitution and all *UNK* of legislation are free will an open society in *UNK* be possible .
p40
aVThe *UNK* Government should lead its citizens on this road to freedom , and Europe should be its *UNK* partner in this .
p41
aVMr President , ladies and gentlemen , the resolution that I have tabled is in response to some tragic events which have recently taken place in *UNK* and in other countries of the world - just yesterday in *UNK* - and is intended to bring to this House 's attention an increasingly serious and intolerable situation whereby members of the Christian community are being persecuted and killed .
p42
aVThis is not a resolution against the *UNK* Government , which has acted to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice ; rather , it is a time to reflect on a vast and concerning issue .
p43
aVEvery year , thousands of *UNK* are killed around the world , in *UNK* , North *UNK* , China , *UNK* , *UNK* , and millions of others are persecuted in the most *UNK* ways for their faith on a daily basis .
p44
aVThese attacks are increasing in number and in *UNK* , *UNK* silence or *UNK* , and they warrant urgent action .
p45
aVFirst of all , everyone must make a commitment to change the climate of religious hatred which is *UNK* and to encourage *UNK* and *UNK* of diversity .
p46
aVEurope is well *UNK* with the tragedy of wars in which , for *UNK* , *UNK* and *UNK* have fought against one another , not to mention the Jewish *UNK* .
p47
aV*UNK* because of its history , Europe must commit itself on this front .
p48
aVAnother initiative could be to examine national laws within the context of which we find rules which *UNK* *UNK* or other religious minorities .
p49
aVThe cooperation of non-governmental organisations could be very useful in this project , but *UNK* is also required to ensure that , where a right to religious freedom exists , it is actually implemented .
p50
aVThis debate could be an opportunity to launch the proposal to draft a European Parliament report on religious freedom in the world .
p51
aVauthor .
p52
aV- ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , religious freedom is , in fact , the subject of this resolution .
p53
aVIt is therefore not an identity *UNK* or an attempt to cause problems for this or that government , but a *UNK* of the fact that , in today 's world , people are *UNK* because they believe in *UNK* or are being *UNK* against because their faith is different from someone else 's .
p54
aVAll the political groups therefore agree that there is a problem concerning religious freedom and that it needs to be addressed seriously and firmly within the international community .
p55
aVWe therefore ask the Council and the Commission and , above all , the High Representative for Foreign Affairs , to pay particular attention to the situation of minorities , including the Christian minority , so that initiatives aimed at promoting dialogue and respect between communities are supported and undertaken , urging all the religious authorities to encourage *UNK* and to prevent *UNK* of hatred and violence from *UNK* .
p56
aVMr President , the incident that took place in *UNK* could undoubtedly have happened elsewhere .
p57
aVA car *UNK* by the *UNK* of a *UNK* *UNK* , *UNK* are *UNK* into the *UNK* .
p58
aVThe outcome : seven deaths ( six *UNK* and one police *UNK* ) .
p59
aVThe *UNK* authorities react quickly .
p60
aVThe public prosecutor *UNK* - and I quote - that the three accused of the events in *UNK* *UNK* will be tried before the State *UNK* Security Court on a charge of *UNK* murder .
p61
aVIn *UNK* , it is the name *UNK* that the Christian and Muslim communities argue about , a dispute that results in the *UNK* and *UNK* of *UNK* .
p62
aVThese news *UNK* , which could be described as *UNK* , have impacts elsewhere , throughout the world , including in Europe .
p63
aVThe rise in religious *UNK* and *UNK* *UNK* a fundamental freedom , freedom of *UNK* for all , whether they are religious or *UNK* .
p64
aVAll over the world , crimes are being *UNK* against minorities , be they Christian , Jewish or Muslim .
p65
aVAll over the world , too , *UNK* men and women are being killed or imprisoned because they do not respect the *UNK* , *UNK* or religious practices from which they have *UNK* themselves .
p66
aVAs a *UNK* person , I firmly support this resolution , which is an appeal for *UNK* and not a *UNK* of *UNK* or *UNK* .
p67
aVHowever , leaving aside the cases that have been mentioned , I would like to point out the responsibility of a state that is *UNK* of its citizens ' right to freedom of expression .
p68
aVI believe that a *UNK* state , by *UNK* of its structure , is the greatest guarantee of the space required for a diversity of *UNK* .
p69
aVThis is the form in which a state can best protect its citizens and promote a dialogue between its communities .
p70
aVauthor .
p71
aV- Mr President , the information about violence against *UNK* in *UNK* and *UNK* is just the *UNK* of the *UNK* .
p72
aVThere are three points I want to raise .
p73
aVFirst , *UNK* have become the victims of brutal violence in many countries of the world , not just two .
p74
aVSecond , *UNK* have become the single most persecuted religious group in the world .
p75
aVThe numbers are *UNK* - in the millions , not thousands or hundreds of thousands .
p76
aV*UNK* , the reaction of European societies , European governments and the EU has , so far , been *UNK* : *UNK* , *UNK* , *UNK* , politically correct , or no reaction at all .
p77
aVWe must act resolutely , or else those who *UNK* *UNK* will think they have our *UNK* *UNK* .
p78
aVDo we really want this ?
p79
aVauthor .
p80
aV- ( *UNK* ) Mr President , it is regrettable that there are so many different conflicts in the world *UNK* up in the *UNK* of religion .
p81
aVIn this connection , it has to be said that there are very many different *UNK* trends in the world in connection with the Christian , Islamic and other *UNK* .
p82
aV*UNK* , I have encountered fewer of these *UNK* *UNK* with *UNK* .
p83
aVIn any case , it is important that the European Parliament adopts a position when these kinds of violent *UNK* between religious groups occur .
p84
aVI would like to say , however , that yesterday it was brought to Parliament 's attention that *UNK* human rights *UNK* were *UNK* arrested when they tried to support the *UNK* *UNK* referred to in this resolution and who were suffering violence against them .
p85
aVI would now like to say to the *UNK* authorities that we need to ensure that people are not prevented in this way from coming to the defence of others .
p86
aVWe must insist that human rights *UNK* in other situations are not imprisoned or treated *UNK* .
p87
aVIn this case , it is an *UNK* fact that these *UNK* *UNK* of the *UNK* were treated *UNK* in prison .
p88
aVThey were kept in inhumane conditions .
p89
aVI hope that in future , Parliament will always give its attention to cases whenever there is violence against any religious group , and not just concentrate on the persecution of *UNK* .
p90
aV( Applause ) Mr President , Tunisia , *UNK* and *UNK* have a great tradition of *UNK* .
p91
aVEvidence of this is provided by names like *UNK* *UNK* *UNK* , the *UNK* of the independent state of *UNK* , or President *UNK* , whose speech here in the European Parliament was like a *UNK* *UNK* for *UNK* coexistence .
p92
aVThis is precisely why we must support the governments of these countries in their fight against Islamic extremism and *UNK* attacks .
p93
aVOf course , we in Europe , as a mainly Christian continent , have a special obligation to stand up for *UNK* throughout the world , because if we do not do so , who will ?
p94
aVHowever , this is clearly about the freedom of religion itself and I would like , for example , to thank the *UNK* Government for the fact that His *UNK* , the *UNK* *UNK* *UNK* , and the Prime Minister , made their position on this matter clear on 9 January .
p95
aVWe wish them success in their fight for religious *UNK* , for which this country was and still is a *UNK* example , and it is something that , as partners who can speak *UNK* on matters to do with human rights , we must preserve in *UNK* , Tunisia and *UNK* .
p96
aVMr President , freedom of religion is an essential element of human rights .
p97
aVUnfortunately , what we are seeing is that *UNK* have a particularly hard time in many countries where the faith of *UNK* *UNK* .
p98
aVThat is the case , amongst other places , in *UNK* .
p99
aV*UNK* *UNK* *UNK* , but also *UNK* *UNK* and *UNK* *UNK* and Jews are placed at a disadvantage in an *UNK* way in *UNK* .
p100
aVMuslims who *UNK* to *UNK* , for example , are *UNK* .
p101
aVThis can be seen from their identity *UNK* , which continue to state that they are Muslims , as religious *UNK* is legally prohibited .
p102
aVOver the last 10 to 20 years , specifically , violence against *UNK* has grown enormously .
p103
aVMore than 100 attacks , with thousands of victims , have already been reported .
p104
aVThe *UNK* Government 's attitude , in my view , is *UNK* .
p105
aVThree men have been taken into *UNK* , but , generally speaking , the violence against *UNK* is *UNK* .
p106
aVI call on the Council and the Commission to engage *UNK* directly in dialogue in order to ensure that the government there takes a different approach .
p107
aVIf Cairo *UNK* to do so , I think that needs to have consequences for our bilateral relations with *UNK* .
p108
aVon behalf of the GUE/NGL Group .
p109
aV- Mr President , all who are committed to democratic rights and freedom of religious expression will condemn *UNK* the murder of *UNK* in *UNK* and also the *UNK* attacks on Christian *UNK* in *UNK* .
p110
aVWe should also note the growing numbers of attacks on religious minorities in Europe itself and equally condemn that .
p111
aVIn *UNK* , the *UNK* of divide and rule on *UNK* and religious lines has long been used by various elements of the economic and ruling *UNK* .
p112
aVThe present National *UNK* government is guilty of *UNK* in this regard : while publicly *UNK* a *UNK* *UNK* ' policy claiming to *UNK* all *UNK* and minorities , it *UNK* behind the scenes , using religious and *UNK* *UNK* to try and *UNK* its own position among the majority Muslim *UNK* population , as it did in relation to the *UNK* ' ruling .
p113
aVThere are also huge *UNK* economically in *UNK* .
p114
aVIt is the most unequal society in *UNK* Asia .
p115
aVThe current government rules on the basis of *UNK* *UNK* .
p116
aVThis is the result , with exploitation *UNK* in the *UNK* and trade union rights *UNK* limited .
p117
aVThe best background for religious freedom and democracy in *UNK* and *UNK* and elsewhere is , indeed , economic justice and democracy , where wealth and power are in the hands of the big majority of working people and the poor and removed from major *UNK* and *UNK* *UNK* .
p118
aV( NL ) Mr President , yesterday , a terrible political trial began in the Netherlands against the leader of our party , *UNK* *UNK* .
p119
aVMr *UNK* , as a Dutch *UNK* and leader of the Party for Freedom in the Dutch Parliament , is being *UNK* for expressing his opinion .
p120
aVMr *UNK* is being persecuted by the *UNK* *UNK* because he *UNK* the Netherlands , Europe and the world about a *UNK* *UNK* that goes by the name of *UNK* .
p121
aVThis is an *UNK* *UNK* !
p122
aVMr President , the *UNK* of the Netherlands and of Europe threatens Europe 's *UNK* and *UNK* culture , and where many , including in this House , *UNK* over *UNK* and allow the *UNK* of *UNK* to *UNK* over them , the Party for Freedom *UNK* for European culture .
p123
aVMr President , the *UNK* acts that have taken place in *UNK* , *UNK* and in many other places around the world , as just this week in *UNK* , are the result of the *UNK* and *UNK* *UNK* known as *UNK* .
p124
aVIn Islamic countries , *UNK* are systematically *UNK* and *UNK* .
p125
aVThe events in *UNK* and *UNK* can not be regarded as isolated incidents , but have their origin in the *UNK* that demands respect but does not give it .
p126
aVThis Parliament can ensure that these terrible events never take place in Europe by taking up the fight , alongside the Party for Freedom , against the *UNK* of Europe .
p127
aVWe ask all of you to do so .
p128
aV( PL ) Mr President , quite often in Parliament , we talk about different *UNK* and their *UNK* social effects .
p129
aVI am thinking of xenophobia and *UNK* .
p130
aVUnfortunately , these two cases do not *UNK* the list of *UNK* .
p131
aVThere is also a phenomenon called *UNK* ' - a *UNK* of *UNK* .
p132
aVJust as in the case of other *UNK* , the social effects here are also *UNK* and sometimes tragic , and it is precisely for this reason that we should take up cases of violations of the rights of *UNK* in different places around the world .
p133
aVWe take up cases involving *UNK* of different *UNK* , and even of people who do not *UNK* any religion .
p134
aV*UNK* , too , must not be deprived of our care .
p135
aVWe do this because religious freedom is one of the European Union 's fundamental values .
p136
aVIt is precisely for this reason that we condemn and will condemn every form of violence , discrimination and *UNK* towards the leaders or *UNK* of any religion .
p137
aV*UNK* *UNK* because of the *UNK* of the *UNK* is *UNK* and there is no doubt that it deserves our criticism .
p138
aV( PL ) Mr President , religious freedom is a right which has been acknowledged in international and European conventions on human rights for over 50 years .
p139
aVAt the same time , we have , for many years , been facing a rising wave of religious hatred , which has most often affected *UNK* all over the world .
p140
aVThe place of *UNK* *UNK* has today been taken principally by *UNK* *UNK* .
p141
aV*UNK* and *UNK* have constitutional guarantees of religious freedom , but under pressure from radical Islamic *UNK* , the religious freedom of *UNK* is not being sufficiently protected by the governments there .
p142
aVThe European Union , which has new instruments of foreign policy at its disposal , must become involved , to a greater degree , in *UNK* *UNK* , which is the source of *UNK* , *UNK* and *UNK* .
p143
aVIt is only ideological prejudice which causes the European Union to do this , today , with *UNK* .
p144
aVAt stake is our credibility .
p145
aV( PL ) Mr President , I would like to support the idea of my fellow Member , Mr *UNK* , who said that a report should be drawn up on religious freedom .
p146
aVI would like to remind everyone that in the previous parliamentary term , Mr *UNK* and I submitted a proposal to draft a report on the situation of *UNK* in countries where they are a minority , in countries where *UNK* is the *UNK* religion .
p147
aVUnfortunately , the Bureau did not adopt the proposal , but perhaps such a report would be worth writing .
p148
aVHere , I make the same proposal again .
p149
aVThe resolution we are adopting today should give a clear message .
p150
aVThe *UNK* minority makes up 10 % of *UNK* 's population , but even if it were only *UNK* % , the role of the European Parliament is to react , especially in a situation in which human rights are being violated so *UNK* .
p151
aVI read carefully the letter sent to Mr *UNK* by the *UNK* of the People 's Assembly .
p152
aVIn the letter , he gives his *UNK* that the events of which I have spoken were isolated incidents .
p153
aVI find this difficult to believe .
p154
aVThe *UNK* have been persecuted in *UNK* for many years .
p155
aVLet us try , this time , to ensure that our help for this *UNK* minority does not end with *UNK* declarations .
p156
aV( PL ) Mr President , it is not only *UNK* , and it is not only *UNK* , but also *UNK* , *UNK* and many other countries in Africa , many countries in Asia and many societies which treat *UNK* as a necessary evil , and sometimes as an enemy .
p157
aVLet us not hide these facts , let us not act like an *UNK* , which *UNK* its head in the *UNK* .
p158
aVThis is a real problem , and the Parliament of a Christian Europe , Christian traditions and a Christian heritage must speak about it .
p159
aVHowever , we should also *UNK* our own *UNK* .
p160
aVA moment ago , the Member who spoke before me rightly spoke of Parliament 's *UNK* of *UNK* in the previous term .
p161
aVI recall the debate we had a few weeks ago , when we rightly condemned the attacks and the *UNK* experienced by the *UNK* Muslim minority in China .
p162
aVHowever , at that time , certain political groups rejected amendments which were intended to emphasise that *UNK* are suffering in China , too , and are the victims of discrimination .
p163
aVWe can not allow a situation in which we defend some religious minorities but defend others less or not at all .
p164
aV( *UNK* ) Mr President , we have heard worrying news from a number of sources about crimes against *UNK* in *UNK* and *UNK* .
p165
aVWith regard to *UNK* , I would first of all like to say that we are deeply concerned about the attacks on *UNK* in what has *UNK* been a *UNK* and *UNK* country .
p166
aVSecondly , I wish to mention the exemplary work of Islamic NGOs on behalf of religious *UNK* .
p167
aVThe *UNK* Prime Minister 's statements about using the name of *UNK* *UNK* a show of public *UNK* targeted at Christian communities .
p168
aVThe exemplary attitude on the part of Islamic NGOs and an *UNK* public stance on the statements by the Prime Minister have nevertheless *UNK* the situation .
p169
aVIt is unfortunate that we did not have it recorded in our final resolution , because in my view , we pay attention too *UNK* here to positive situations .
p170
aVShould not Muslims also be *UNK* when there is cause to do so ?
p171
aV*UNK* *UNK* needs to be promoted both by those that hold political power and at *UNK* level .
p172
aVIt is equally important to realise that there have been *UNK* as it is to acknowledge progress and offer support for it .
p173
aV( FR ) Mr President , the acts of *UNK* criminals , who have killed some *UNK* in *UNK* , can not be *UNK* to an entire population and its government .
p174
aVIt would be unfair to hold *UNK* and the *UNK* responsible for this appalling *UNK* , for which the *UNK* will be brought to justice .
p175
aVWe must not *UNK* the acts of one criminal with the policy of an entire country !
p176
aVLet us not *UNK* *UNK* and an entire population with the same *UNK* .
p177
aVFinally , by seeking to intervene between the *UNK* *UNK* and their fellow Muslim citizens , we are adding fuel to the *UNK* of the *UNK* , who want to *UNK* Eastern *UNK* as agents of the West .
p178
aV( *UNK* ) There is very recent news that a few days ago , the *UNK* regime arrested several *UNK* rights *UNK* who were travelling to the *UNK* of the crimes that took place at the *UNK* *UNK* settlement in order to defend and support the *UNK* Christian communities there who had seen several of their members *UNK* on Christmas Day .
p179
aVThe *UNK* authorities , *UNK* towards the Muslim majority , are trying to *UNK* the violent acts committed against the *UNK* minority , and are now *UNK* the *UNK* ' *UNK* *UNK* with discriminatory *UNK* towards one side of the issue .
p180
aVThe United States administration has unequivocally spoken up against this .
p181
aV*UNK* that the *UNK* Christian community , who are considered *UNK* *UNK* , have , for over 1 500 years , often been subjected to *UNK* *UNK* , the European Union must step up in its defence even more forcefully and *UNK* than it is doing at present .
p182
aV( SK ) Thank you for bringing attention again to the breaches of religious freedom in certain countries , just like back in 2007 and 2008 .
p183
aVI wonder whether it is the EU 's *UNK* or *UNK* that *UNK* it from promoting the *UNK* of human rights in this area more consistently .
p184
aVWe keep hearing the same complaints and proposing the same measures .
p185
aV*UNK* and *UNK* are among those countries where *UNK* live in extremely dangerous conditions , face persecution , *UNK* from their homes , *UNK* and *UNK* , and their *UNK* are being closed .
p186
aVThis is happening from the *UNK* to Iran , in *UNK* , China , *UNK* , and many other countries .
p187
aV*UNK* are usually persecuted by extremist groups .
p188
aVHowever , this *UNK* a danger to all *UNK* , Jews and Muslims .
p189
aVI request that representatives of the EU and delegations of the European Parliament make use of every opportunity to improve dialogue , religious *UNK* and respect , and the coexistence of different *UNK* .
p190
aV( *UNK* ) Mr President , I am especially worried about the situation in *UNK* because of the historical , ethnic and political background connected with it .
p191
aV*UNK* , the *UNK* *UNK* are still a considerable minority .
p192
aVIn *UNK* , around 10 % of the population , eight million , are *UNK* *UNK* , and it is for that precise reason that they are a former majority .
p193
aVThey are proud of this and also of their *UNK* Christian tradition .
p194
aVThis is why the *UNK* that occurred at the Christmas *UNK* last January was particularly blatant and *UNK* .
p195
aVFurthermore , many *UNK* have been *UNK* through violence to change their *UNK* and there have been cases of *UNK* and other crimes .
p196
aVThe situation in *UNK* is a very bad example for other countries where there is a chance of the same sort of *UNK* of *UNK* taking place , and that is precisely why the EU has to be vigilant , intervene immediately when there is *UNK* , and stress the importance of peaceful dialogue between religious groups .
p197
aV( *UNK* ) When a murder takes place , in particular , a *UNK* motivated one , we naturally can do little but *UNK* in *UNK* and condemn it .
p198
aVHowever , this new incident and this new crime in the Middle East is , in fact , evidence of general developments and ongoing *UNK* of religious freedom and lack of respect for those who are different .
p199
aVThat is to say , there are many *UNK* where religious values are not respected .
p200
aVThe reason why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has proposed that this debate be postponed , or rather , that debates on the respect of human rights and religious freedoms in *UNK* and *UNK* be held separately , is that we need to deal with this issue with a great deal of sensitivity and address every country individually .
p201
aV*UNK* is certainly not one of the worst examples of religious *UNK* .
p202
aVQuite the contrary .
p203
aVMr President , sadly , there has been a general climate in the Islamic world of increasing *UNK* *UNK* aimed at *UNK* communities in their *UNK* - in particular , and more often than not , this means the *UNK* .
p204
aVThe *UNK* , who represent one of the *UNK* Christian *UNK* in the world , have a large *UNK* in *UNK* , which I represent .
p205
aVTheir leaders have come to me and *UNK* of a *UNK* situation , *UNK* , in *UNK* , *UNK* by the Muslim *UNK* .
p206
aVIn spite of the best efforts by President *UNK* 's government to protect them , matters have *UNK* .
p207
aVWe witness a similar story with the *UNK* *UNK* in Iraq , the *UNK* of *UNK* and *UNK* , and now , as we see for the first time , even in *UNK* .
p208
aVThis House has - for too long , in my view - ignored Christian minority rights in the rest of the world , but they look to the European Union and to the United States for protection .
p209
aVSo I welcome this resolution .
p210
aVMr President , the persecution of *UNK* and other religious minorities is growing in Islamic countries .
p211
aV*UNK* who have *UNK* in countries such as *UNK* and in the Mediterranean area for almost 2 000 years are increasingly being persecuted and driven out of their *UNK* *UNK* .
p212
aVThis is because of the growing power of *UNK* *UNK* and extremist *UNK* *UNK* - *UNK* .
p213
aVThe persecution of Christian minorities and others across the Islamic world is *UNK* *UNK* by the West 's media .
p214
aVThe media should not only report the persecution as it happens but they should explain to the general public the reasons why it is happening .
p215
aVThey should explain who is doing this , namely Muslim *UNK* , and why they are doing it - because of the *UNK* and violent fault lines in Islamic *UNK* .
p216
aVDemocratic governments worldwide should put maximum diplomatic pressure on countries such as *UNK* to *UNK* this intolerable persecution .
p217
aVMember of the Commission .
p218
aV- Mr President , the Commission is deeply *UNK* and *UNK* by what happened on *UNK* Christmas *UNK* in *UNK* *UNK* in southern *UNK* , the tragic deaths of six *UNK* and a Muslim *UNK* in a *UNK* *UNK* .
p219
aVWe are positive that the authorities took rapid action to find and arrest those *UNK* of *UNK* this awful crime , and a thorough investigation and bringing those responsible to justice will send a clear signal that violence based on religious influence is not acceptable in *UNK* society .
p220
aV*UNK* 's Constitution provides for freedom of *UNK* and free practice of religion .
p221
aVHowever , we do hear complaints of discrimination against the *UNK* and against other religious minorities such as the *UNK* in the *UNK* and by the judicial system .
p222
aVWe are aware of difficulties encountered by several Christian *UNK* , such as *UNK* *UNK* and *UNK* *UNK* , in *UNK* courts .
p223
aVWe raised those issues in our regular political dialogue with *UNK* .
p224
aVWe understand that the government is seeking to address some of the *UNK* of the *UNK* , for instance , by removing the obstacles that delay and limit the building and *UNK* of *UNK* .
p225
aVWe welcome and encourage such moves and urge the government to identify and tackle the root causes of religious *UNK* in *UNK* society and to end all forms of discrimination against those *UNK* to other *UNK* .
p226
aVThe acts of *UNK* against *UNK* in *UNK* following a High Court ruling on the use of the word *UNK* ' give rise to serious concerns .
p227
aVThe government , as well as the opposition , including the *UNK* Islamic Party and *UNK* Muslim NGOs , have all strongly condemned those attacks .
p228
aVThe government has increased security measures to safeguard all places of *UNK* and has also *UNK* its commitment to protect *UNK* 's social and religious *UNK* and a culture of religious and ethnic diversity .
p229
aVThe *UNK* *UNK* Constitution states that *UNK* is the religion of the Federation but other *UNK* may be *UNK* in peace and in *UNK* in any part of the Federation .
p230
aVWe encourage the authorities to initiate as soon as possible an *UNK* *UNK* dialogue with all religious *UNK* to promote mutual understanding so that *UNK* can continue to develop *UNK* in ethnic and social *UNK* .
p231
aVIn that regard , the *UNK* Home *UNK* has a particular responsibility to explain *UNK* and objectively to its citizens the issue at stake .
p232
aVWe strongly condemn all acts of *UNK* against any person because of his religion of *UNK* wherever they occur .
p233
aVUnfortunately , no country is *UNK* from this .
p234
aVWe call on public authorities to fully protect all religious communities , including *UNK* , from discrimination and from repression .
p235
aVThe Commission gives high priority to freedom of religion or *UNK* as central *UNK* of the EU 's human rights policy by raising the issue in political dialogue with countries where the problem *UNK* , by supporting local human rights projects and by actively promoting freedom of religion or *UNK* at the UN *UNK* .
p236
aVThe debate is closed .
p237
aVThe vote will take place at *UNK* .
p238
aVWritten statements ( Rule *UNK* ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in voting in favour of the joint resolution , I am highlighting the particular seriousness of the violence carried out in *UNK* in response to an exclusively *UNK* issue .
p239
aVIndeed , it is certain that both *UNK* and Muslims believe in only one God , who is the God of all men , *UNK* and *UNK* *UNK* .
p240
aVThe fact that He is referred to by different names is absolutely secondary .
p241
aVTo claim that the Muslim God is only Muslim and can therefore be *UNK* only by Muslims , using a *UNK* Muslim name , means *UNK* to the *UNK* and *UNK* view that there is a God for each group of human beings .
p242
aVIn other words , it means *UNK* the *UNK* idea that makes universal *UNK* which , like *UNK* and *UNK* , oppose *UNK* and *UNK* , great *UNK* that are close to people .
p243
aVNo less serious is the persecution of the *UNK* in *UNK* .
p244
aVIt was on the *UNK* of the Mediterranean that *UNK* *UNK* , which claim to be , and are , forces for promoting *UNK* and peace , were *UNK* .
p245
aVHowever , it is remarkable that it should be precisely on the *UNK* of the Mediterranean , in *UNK* - a *UNK* city for those who believe in God , *UNK* and *UNK* - that the main *UNK* ground for conflict is found .
p246
aVIt is precisely *UNK* that is the most powerful country in the area , where *UNK* and Muslims must *UNK* *UNK* in order to play a *UNK* role throughout the southern Mediterranean area .
p247
aVI support the joint motion for a resolution on the recent attacks against Christian communities because it strongly condemns all kinds of violence , discrimination or *UNK* that is based on religion or *UNK* .
p248
aVI think that it is vital to support all initiatives that are aimed at encouraging dialogue and mutual respect between communities and which seek to safeguard fundamental rights such as freedom of thought , *UNK* and religion .
p249
aV*UNK* and women all over the world continue to suffer the most brutal forms of persecution simply because they believe in God in the same way that He is *UNK* from the Atlantic to the *UNK* *UNK* .
p250
aVFollowing statements by China , *UNK* , Iraq , *UNK* , Turkey and *UNK* , among others , Parliament today condemned the *UNK* of *UNK* in *UNK* and *UNK* .
p251
aVEurope views all this with relative *UNK* .
p252
aVThere are even those who defend this failure to act by *UNK* respect for other people 's culture and freedom to *UNK* .
p253
aVEurope 's silence on this issue , truly *UNK* in a region whose *UNK* , culture and traditions are *UNK* with the Christian faith , threatens to become *UNK* ...
p254
aVThis brings to mind the *UNK* *UNK* of *UNK* 's comment on earlier *UNK* , which *UNK* illustrate the spirit of our times , whereby he noted that people are *UNK* to *UNK* about the fate of *UNK* bears than about the thousands of *UNK* who live their lives under threat .
p255
aVAnother year , 2010 , has started with the *UNK* persecution of *UNK* in many parts of the world .
p256
aVWe can not , as the European Parliament , be *UNK* in the face of these crimes and acts of violence .
p257
aVThe situation of *UNK* is equally dramatic in countries not mentioned in today 's resolution , such as North *UNK* , Iraq , *UNK* and *UNK* .
p258
aV*UNK* on *UNK* are increasing in *UNK* .
p259
aVAs a Member from Poland , a country with a *UNK* Christian tradition and a country with a long tradition of respect where many religious communities *UNK* , I would like to express solidarity with the families of the victims .
p260
aVThe *UNK* and *UNK* authorities must guarantee *UNK* and members of other communities and religious minorities the possibility to enjoy all human rights and fundamental freedoms , or face sanctions from the European Union .
p261
aVFor this reason , we should endorse the resolution on recent attacks on Christian communities .
p262
aVThe recent attacks against Christian communities in *UNK* and *UNK* can be viewed from two different perspectives .
p263
aVFirst , we must emphasise that the European Union , as a community of European States that have reached a high level of democracy and the rule of law , must not , in the spirit of religious *UNK* , human and minority rights , pass over such events in silence , regardless of where in the world they may occur .
p264
aVWe must make it clear to governments that strive to continue to maintain good relations with us that Europe demands that the *UNK* accepted norms of universal human rights be respected by its partners , and that the future development of relations can be affected by problems involving human rights .
p265
aVAt the same time , we must not forget the infringements of human rights that occur on the territory of the European Union .
p266
aVIn some cases , religious *UNK* , human and minority rights - including those of members of minority *UNK* - need to be developed further in EU Member States as well .
p267
aVIf Europe wants to set an example to the world , it can not allow anyone on its territory to suffer discrimination for his or her religious *UNK* , ethnic origin or membership of a national minority .
p268
aVWe can see that the legislation in force in *UNK* *UNK* guarantees religious freedom , but in practice , the experience of *UNK* is that the opposite is the case .
p269
aVUnfortunately , we can find similar examples of a *UNK* between the law and daily practice in EU Member States as well .
p270
aV10 .
p271
aVThe *UNK* *UNK* and student mobility ( Written declarations for entry in the register ( Rule *UNK* ) : see Minutes Economic governance in the EU and the *UNK* , and surveillance of national budgets ( debate ) The next item is the statement by the President of the Commission on economic governance in the EU and the *UNK* , and surveillance of national budgets .
p272
aVMr President , ladies and gentlemen , economic governance constitutes a crucial challenge for the future of our Union .
p273
aVWhen , in 1993 , President *UNK* made clear the need for a deeper coordination of economic policies , many Member States rejected this .
p274
aVFurthermore , when the first Commission - which I had the honour of *UNK* over - brought up this question in its report on the *UNK* anniversary of economic and monetary union , in 2008 , not many people *UNK* .
p275
aVI nevertheless emphasised the need to provide an adequate response to the question of economic governance in my guidelines for the present term , which we discussed together about a year ago .
p276
aVCommissioner *UNK* *UNK* then discussed this with you during his hearing .
p277
aVBy that time , the Commission had already announced its intention to put forward proposals to strengthen economic governance in the European Union , particularly in the euro area .
p278
aVUnfortunately , the crisis has shown that we were right .
p279
aVHowever , the urgency of this debate is now recognised , and I can only welcome the fact that the conditions have finally come together for *UNK* towards a true European economic governance .
p280
aVAs a result , the Commission provided detailed proposals on 12 May .
p281
aVThese proposals have kept the debate *UNK* , including with the European Parliament , and particularly the work of the task force *UNK* over by the President of the European Council .
p282
aVThe Commission is pleased with the progress of this work and with the consensus achieved up to now , which was shown very clearly during the European Council .
p283
aVIn order to maintain this dynamic , last Wednesday , the Commission again adopted a range of proposals which , once *UNK* into legislative initiatives , will be able to be implemented from 2011 if they are adopted in good time .
p284
aVThese proposals do not involve changing the treaty .
p285
aVWe must act now , within the legal context that we have today .
p286
aVThis is not a *UNK* .
p287
aVThe new possibilities that the Treaty of Lisbon offers us can and must be fully *UNK* , because we no longer have the time to wait .
p288
aVOur citizens , our businesses and our economy are demanding that we take initiatives .
p289
aVIt is our responsibility to decide and to act now .
p290
aVBecause of the economic crisis , the European Union has been faced with a series of serious *UNK* .
p291
aVThe *UNK* of economic governance is , of course , just one aspect of the European Union response to the crisis .
p292
aVThe response has also included other *UNK* : the comprehensive reform of the regulation of financial markets and proposals for a new European *UNK* *UNK* .
p293
aVAs I said this morning , a deal is within reach in the coming days .
p294
aVI call on all parties to maintain the positive dynamic , to ensure that new authorities can start their work in early 2011 .
p295
aVThis will also keep Europe in the lead in implementing our G20 commitments in this area : the measures to secure financial stability , first through the Greece Programme and then through the mechanisms for the euro area as a whole and , last but not least , a programme for growth and jobs through structural reforms included in the Europe 2020 strategy .
p296
aVOur response to the crisis is a *UNK* one .
p297
aVWe *UNK* , we consolidate and we *UNK* .
p298
aVWe prepare our social market economy to ensure a better future for our citizens .
p299
aVBut for now , let me focus on governance .
p300
aVThe challenge of the past few months has *UNK* on whether our economic governance is equal to the new pressures placed on our economic and fiscal stability .
p301
aVWe have the treaty provisions in place which allow us to act .
p302
aVWe have the institutions .
p303
aVWe need to make it work .
p304
aVWe faced a real risk and we successfully *UNK* it .
p305
aVNow we are *UNK* in the *UNK* we have identified to *UNK* such risks for the future .
p306
aVI first announced to Parliament the ideas we *UNK* out in the Commission communication of 12 May .
p307
aVOur debates since then are reflected in the Commission communication of 30 June .
p308
aVNow we are moving on to the operational phase , with the Commission ready to submit legislative proposals as early as September .
p309
aVBefore *UNK* the issues in detail , I would like to emphasise how much this process has *UNK* from the work with the European Council , the task force *UNK* by the President of the European Council , and indeed the *UNK* of Parliament .
p310
aVThis work has helped to build a real European momentum .
p311
aVI hope that this will translate later into a swift consideration and swift adoption of legislative proposals .
p312
aVOur approach to economic governance is to have rules that are more comprehensive and more efficient .
p313
aVThe current treaty gives us *UNK* of scope to do this and I am convinced that the Community method will once again give us the right answer .
p314
aVWe need a stronger surveillance regime .
p315
aVThat means one that is *UNK* and broader , covering budgetary , macro-economic and structural policies , a regime that acknowledges the reality that every Member State has its own *UNK* but a regime that also reflects the *UNK* we all know is central to the European economy .
p316
aVWhat does this mean in detail ?
p317
aVFirst , we need more coordination .
p318
aV*UNK* to this is the 'European *UNK* ' .
p319
aVIt will enhance economic transparency and encourage *UNK* *UNK* , *UNK* *UNK* , among Member States .
p320
aVIf Member States submit their stability and convergence programmes and their national reform programmes simultaneously , we will have a truly *UNK* approach .
p321
aVThis European perspective will be an asset for Member States as they plan , discuss and adopt their national budgets according to their national constitutional procedures .
p322
aVSecond , we need the credibility that comes with better enforcement .
p323
aVThis means a *UNK* incentives and sanctions *UNK* , a more effective *UNK* of both *UNK* and *UNK* action .
p324
aVWe need a Stability and Growth Pact that is targeted , not only regarding the deficit criterion but also on debt : a pact that has real *UNK* and is respected .
p325
aVOf course , the most effective sanctions are those that do not need to be used because they create the incentive to comply - but , in order to achieve this , the rules need to be strong enough to *UNK* this respect .
p326
aVI want to be very clear on this .
p327
aVWithout a more stringent system of incentives and sanctions , we will not reinforce economic governance in a credible way .
p328
aVIf a Member State does not respect the *UNK* agreed rules , then it must be prepared to suffer the consequences .
p329
aVThis means also that sanctions must be designed so as to apply to all Member States on an equal basis .
p330
aVParliament can be *UNK* that the Commission will do its utmost to ensure that this will be the case .
p331
aVAs regards financial sanctions , we proposed to base them on a broader range of expenditure from the EU budget than before .
p332
aVIn a *UNK* , all Member States should , in future , face the risk of losing money from the EU budget in the event of persistent failure to comply with the fiscal rules .
p333
aVThe application of these rules should also be *UNK* as regards the *UNK* arm of the Stability and Growth Pact .
p334
aVThe *UNK* of measures is also key .
p335
aVWe must not fall into the *UNK* of waiting too long before sanctions *UNK* in .
p336
aV*UNK* and sanctions must be brought *UNK* so that action is *UNK* before the situation gets out of hand .
p337
aV*UNK* action can be much more effective than *UNK* action - but it requires discipline and political will .
p338
aVOne of the weakest points of our current rules is the absence of mechanisms to deal with problems *UNK* in so-called *UNK* times ' .
p339
aVWe are addressing this in our proposals , in particular , as regards the euro area .
p340
aV*UNK* , our surveillance needs to *UNK* all the key elements .
p341
aVIt must not be restricted to fiscal policy alone .
p342
aVWe have seen that such a *UNK* perspective does not work .
p343
aVWe must have tools to *UNK* macro-economic imbalances among Member States .
p344
aVSuch imbalances *UNK* the cohesion of the EU and , in particular , of the euro area .
p345
aVA comprehensive *UNK* of indicators will give us what we need to identify increasing *UNK* and to propose *UNK* .
p346
aVThey need , of course , to be *UNK* by appropriate enforcement mechanisms for such *UNK* .
p347
aVFourth , as well as *UNK* fiscal rules , we also need to push the structural reforms , innovation and trade that will put Europe back on track in terms of growth and create jobs for the future .
p348
aVThat is what our Europe 2020 strategy is all about .
p349
aVThe European Council endorsed it a *UNK* ago .
p350
aVNow we need to put it into practice to ensure that national and European policies are fully in tune , creating the *UNK* cycle where growth in one part of Europe helps drive growth in another .
p351
aV*UNK* , let me repeat the utmost importance of transparent and robust financial market regulation , and call on all actors in the process to adopt the necessary reforms as quickly as possible .
p352
aVI would like to underline the historic dimension of the reforms we are putting forward .
p353
aVThey constitute an answer to the challenges that our single currency is facing in Europe , but they also have an important impact in the global financial markets .
p354
aVThe time has come to give the Economic and Monetary Union the tools it needs to fully function , in order to ensure its credibility .
p355
aVWhat is at stake is not just some technical rules .
p356
aVWhat is at stake is the future of the euro and we can say , to some extent , it is the future of our European project .
p357
aVTo make all this possible , we have to show without any possible doubts that the world has changed and that our proposals on economic governance are not more of the same , but the real *UNK* .
p358
aVToday , the conditions have been met to bring together the Stability and Growth Pact , economic governance and the structural reforms in a consistent system within the Economic and Monetary Union .
p359
aVThis system should *UNK* all our tools for the common objective : the Structural Funds , budget surveillance and the reforms provided for in the Europe 2020 strategy .
p360
aVThis is a strategy for the whole Union .
p361
aVThis is not just an addition of different strategies .
p362
aVIt is a real economic strategy for Europe , but we can only have a European economic strategy if we have a truly economic system of governance .
p363
aVHowever , the system of incentives and sanctions should reflect the special responsibilities of Member States that have already adopted the single currency , in strict compliance with the legal framework .
p364
aVThose Member States share a common good called the euro and it would not be acceptable for the *UNK* of some members to put all the others at risk .
p365
aVI am convinced that these proposals will mean a step change in the economic consistency of the Union , while at the same time preserving the inevitable *UNK* between those Member States who are members of the euro area and , of course , respecting those who are not yet .
p366
aVThe current situation requires ambition and *UNK* : the proposals of the Commission will send out a strong message , both inside the EU and worldwide , that the European Union is equal to the task .
p367
aVIt is therefore paramount that our three institutions work consistently and in a spirit of close cooperation to finalise and approve these proposals with mutual confidence and *UNK* in our common future .
p368
aVIt is important that all our partners worldwide understand that we are ready to do whatever it takes to defend the euro and the stability of our common currency .
p369
aVThe Commission 's task is to use its right of initiative to further the common interest of Europe and its citizens .
p370
aVIt is determined to fulfil this task and is convinced that these proposals are the right way forward for Europe .
p371
aV( Applause ) President *UNK* , Commissioner *UNK* , your proposals are an important step towards strengthening economic governance in Europe .
p372
aVI should like to pay tribute to you for actively exercising your right of initiative rather than waiting to see what the Council 's task force comes up with .
p373
aVOur group , the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) , welcomes the proposals and wishes to cooperate closely and *UNK* with you and the Council to *UNK* them .
p374
aVIt also wishes to cooperate on taking the next step towards the Community method .
p375
aVWhat is needed is not new institutions but instead a strong , independent role for the European Commission , and a European Council that commits itself to a common approach and democratic control by the European Parliament .
p376
aVAs far as the PPE Group is concerned , these are the *UNK* for the legislative proposals you are to present to us in early September .
p377
aVWe have great expectations of the European *UNK* and the coordination of national action programmes .
p378
aV*UNK* reforms and painful measures in the Member States are necessary in order to strengthen their competitiveness .
p379
aVThis will create jobs and prosperity for our citizens .
p380
aVWe also have great expectations of the measures to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact using a big *UNK* : sanctions , that is .
p381
aVYou called the series of measures a *UNK* ' .
p382
aVA great deal will depend on the specific contents of this *UNK* .
p383
aVOne of our Dutch *UNK* *UNK* has the *UNK* *UNK* not words ' .
p384
aV*UNK* not words is exactly what Parliament wants when it comes to strengthening economic governance , and also when it comes to the legislation on European supervision of the financial institutions .
p385
aVThe Council *UNK* the report by *UNK* de *UNK* , but this must now be put into practice , *UNK* into legislation - *UNK* authorities with real powers that can start work on 1 January - and so the Council now needs to actually do this .
p386
aVParliament will be voting tomorrow , but we shall leave the door open for the Council to conclude an agreement during the meeting of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council this month .
p387
aVThis means *UNK* Parliament 's position on the powers for this new *UNK* authority , as Parliament will stand firm - not in its own interests but in those of the public - in order to restore calm to the financial markets , so that we can once more look to the future with confidence .
p388
aVon behalf of the *UNK* *UNK* *UNK* Group .
p389
aV- Mr President , we *UNK* that President *UNK* and Commissioner *UNK* 's proposals lack balance .
p390
aV*UNK* stability can not exist in isolation from strong economic growth and high levels of employment .
p391
aV*UNK* and further planned *UNK* measures will lead to a sustained period of low growth , increasing unemployment and further social exclusion .
p392
aVPresident *UNK* , I know that you do not believe that millions more unemployed and more social exclusion are an acceptable price to pay for rapid fiscal consolidation , but that seems to be the path you are *UNK* .
p393
aVIn your proposals of last week , I think you are missing the point .
p394
aVThere is a need for a qualitative leap in European economic policy and in its governance , but that should lead to a balanced policy agenda *UNK* fiscal responsibility with economic effectiveness and social *UNK* .
p395
aVYou have left out several highly relevant options that would really mean a qualitative leap in this field .
p396
aV*UNK* economic policy coordination should provide for a more differentiated consolidation plan for Europe , instead of the *UNK* *UNK* size *UNK* all ' *UNK* agenda that makes no economic sense .
p397
aVSecond , you must come forward with an economic policy agenda for jobs and fiscal consolidation .
p398
aVToday , we only have an agenda for *UNK* *UNK* at the expense of jobs .
p399
aV*UNK* , we need strong proposals on how to safeguard proper public financing for the recently agreed Europe 2020 strategy , including new tax *UNK* from financial *UNK* taxes and other sources .
p400
aVWe also urgently need operational proposals from you , the Commission , on how to shift the tax burden away from labour as rapidly as possible .
p401
aV*UNK* on labour is far too high in a number of Member States .
p402
aVLast but not least , you have stopped short of positive incentives , rather than negative sanctions , in a renewed Stability and Growth Pact , although that could be a very *UNK* path to *UNK* .
p403
aVI hope you will reconsider and come forward with a more balanced set of proposals in the *UNK* .
p404
aVMr President , I am satisfied with the presentation of the package by the President of the Commission and , if I may give my opinion , I would suggest that you bring it in as soon as possible on the basis of your right of initiative .
p405
aV*UNK* it on the table of the Council and put it to the European Parliament , because that is the mechanism by which the Union *UNK* .
p406
aVThe Commission has the initiative here .
p407
aVI would thus like to wish the *UNK* working group much success , but ultimately , the Commission will have to abide by its responsibilities and put a proposal to the various institutions .
p408
aVNevertheless , Mr President , some questions remain concerning this package .
p409
aVThe first question , which is fundamental , is : who will manage this economic governance ?
p410
aVWill it be the Member States , the Council or the Community institutions - that is , the European Central Bank and the European Commission ?
p411
aVFor the European Parliament , it is very clear : it has to be the Community authorities , because I have never seen the Member States demonstrate an ability to exercise this control themselves .
p412
aVThis does not work : it has never worked in the past , and it will not work in the future either .
p413
aVSecondly , I agree that penalties should be envisaged , but not only concerning the Stability Pact , because , as you have said , this is only one aspect of the policy .
p414
aVWe must also do this , for example , with regard to competitiveness , structural reforms and the European economy .
p415
aVThere must be penalties , and on this point , I would ask certain Member States to show more consistency .
p416
aVThey defend - even demand - penalties relating to the Stability Pact , but when we talk of penalties with regard to Europe 2020 , from the competitiveness perspective , they are much more *UNK* .
p417
aVIt must be one thing or the other .
p418
aVIf we want penalties , they must be applied across the board .
p419
aVMy third comment is that we must also think , President of the Commission , of a strategy for economic growth .
p420
aVWe can not just say that we will reduce the *UNK* .
p421
aVIt is necessary to make this reduction - and as a former budget *UNK* , I want to reduce *UNK* - but apart from that , we also need an economic growth policy , and the only authority that can provide that is the European Union .
p422
aVThe Union has *UNK* capacity , and it has projects for the pan-European infrastructure that we need , as Mr *UNK* 's report emphasises , and the Commission must therefore make proposals in this direction too .
p423
aVIt must do this not only with a view to reducing the *UNK* - which is necessary because the Stability Pact requires it - but also with a view to developing a credible economic growth strategy so that we do not fall into the *UNK* of economic *UNK* of the *UNK* type , such as the one that we experienced for more than ten years .
p424
aVThe fourth element is the *UNK* *UNK* ' .
p425
aVI am satisfied with the fact that the decision has been taken to *UNK* these .
p426
aVWe already needed to do this a year ago , as the Americans did , because it is the only way of *UNK* the supply of credit in the private sector .
p427
aVFinally - and I will stop there , Mr President - as regards financial supervision , let us be very clear on this point : there will not be any agreement with Parliament if the Council and the Member States do not respect the fact that in case of conflict , it is the European authority that has the last word .
p428
aVThis is a crucial point .
p429
aVFurthermore , this element is repeated in the Commission 's proposals .
p430
aVThis is the point of *UNK* for the *UNK* exercise .
p431
aVThe Member States have not yet understood .
p432
aVIt is time , Mr President , that the Member States accepted this , otherwise there will be no agreement on financial supervision .
p433
aVMr President , many thanks for making this statement .
p434
aVI feel that we ought to be very careful not to continue falling back into old ways in a very difficult situation .
p435
aVWhat I mean by *UNK* ways ' is the *UNK* political groups *UNK* budget *UNK* and competitiveness problems , while the *UNK* groups go on about the risks of *UNK* measures .
p436
aVAs far as I see it , we will not make any progress this way .
p437
aVOn the other hand , if you take a fair look at this proposal , you have to admit that it contains signs of significant progress , for instance , with regard to budget coordination .
p438
aVIt also specifically mentions imbalances .
p439
aVUntil recently , it was still almost impossible to talk about imbalances seriously .
p440
aVThe fact that sanctions should be applied if Member States fail to do their *UNK* is also a sign of progress .
p441
aVHowever , this proposal also has blind *UNK* , which is something that we can no longer expect ourselves and our citizens to accept .
p442
aVThis obviously means economic governance and also talking about tax issues .
p443
aVThe fact is that we have tax havens , large areas of the economy which go *UNK* , not to mention excessive tax competition .
p444
aVThese must stop being *UNK* subjects and obviously have a place in such a statement .
p445
aVSecondly , it is not enough to coordinate budget policy only in the way it was described .
p446
aVWe must ensure that budget policy is *UNK* , enabling it therefore to *UNK* crises .
p447
aVUnfortunately , this does not feature in the text .
p448
aVFurthermore , it is *UNK* still *UNK* to say that in the case of imbalances , there are countries in deficit and those in *UNK* , with both sides making their specific contributions .
p449
aVUnfortunately , you are still lacking the courage to explain things as clearly as is necessary .
p450
aVWe have problems with asset prices and *UNK* .
p451
aVThis is not mentioned explicitly either .
p452
aVThe point I am making is that we should at least be *UNK* and put aside our ideological differences after this crisis for a time and take a look at all the causes of the crisis , instead of looking for these problems from a *UNK* perspective .
p453
aVIt is no longer enough now to make progress in this crisis .
p454
aVOur citizens are expecting *UNK* , comprehensive solutions , which is no more than they deserve .
p455
aVon behalf of the *UNK* Group .
p456
aV- Mr President , economic governance , *UNK* *UNK* , cross-border *UNK* tools : these are all very important areas *UNK* financial crisis .
p457
aVFor all these areas , we need to ensure that a strong and *UNK* structure is put in place as soon as possible in order to ensure that we can deliver a common set of rules , whether for Member States accounts and their behaviour in economic governance , or for our financial services reform .
p458
aVWe need to arrive at consensus .
p459
aVThe outcome needs to be fully implemented by all 27 Member States and be fully complied with .
p460
aVAny new institutions need to be *UNK* , and *UNK* of staff should be based , above all else , on merit and ability to do the task at hand .
p461
aVWe need to send a clear signal that these new procedures and *UNK* authorities , especially the proposed European *UNK* *UNK* Board , are necessary and can work for the benefit of our *UNK* and our collective economies .
p462
aVThe recent financial and economic crisis has *UNK* *UNK* measures .
p463
aVIn Europe , we have identified areas in which regulatory *UNK* can be *UNK* and will *UNK* also improve the transparency of our markets and financial services as a whole .
p464
aVThe recent agreement on the US finance bill has been *UNK* by many as putting the US regulatory reform ahead of the EU .
p465
aVI do not agree with this conclusion .
p466
aVIf we can find agreement on the *UNK* *UNK* over the coming days and weeks , we will have a robust EU framework *UNK* on a new European *UNK* *UNK* Board and the three Lamfalussy committees *UNK* into European authorities .
p467
aVOnce this framework has been established , it should aid the safety of the financial system and may even prove to be a vehicle to improve the functioning of the single market in financial services .
p468
aVIn following this agenda , we do , however , need to ensure that any new authorities established work effectively with national *UNK* bodies and that , at all times , these discussions and negotiations strive for the best structure , the best supervision and the best outcome , rather than whether it is *UNK* ' or *UNK* Europe ' .
p469
aVI commend the Commission 's focus in addressing the key issues of concern and believe that although by very different methods , we will soon end up with a global financial system which is safer and better serves our economy .
p470
aVMr President , in the wake of the measures proposed by the Commission in recent weeks for *UNK* *UNK* crises , involving the euro rescue package and the Europe 2020 strategy , which *UNK* *UNK* the banks , on the one hand , and cuts in social security , *UNK* and pensions , on the other , we now have proposals on the table for reforming the Stability and Growth Pact .
p471
aVIn our view , these proposals from the Commission on reforming the Stability and Growth Pact are taking the wrong *UNK* .
p472
aVThe Commission , following in the *UNK* of the working group headed by President Van *UNK* , does not want to modify the Pact 's content , but instead wants to *UNK* the sanctions and enforce compliance .
p473
aVBoth the Commission and Council are calling for further controls and penalties for Member States in deficit .
p474
aVThis has not worked in the past and will not work in the future .
p475
aVHowever , we in the European Parliament 's Confederal Group of the European United Left - *UNK* Green Left are pleased , at any rate , that the *UNK* penalties proposed by the Commission for countries in deficit were not applied .
p476
aVRegulation of the financial markets is a matter of urgency .
p477
aVWe will do our part to resolve the situation .
p478
aVEurope 's citizens already have to pay ; the Council now ought finally to *UNK* into action as well .
p479
aVThe problems with the Stability and Growth *UNK* are not down to lack of compliance or the rapid reduction of the annual deficit to the Maastricht target of 3 % of new debt .
p480
aVThis may *UNK* growth in the euro area , which is still *UNK* and at risk .
p481
aVThe current economic imbalances in the EU must be *UNK* , as this is what *UNK* are making their living from .
p482
aVOne of the ways to do this is for the countries with strong economies to drop their *UNK* export strategies which have *UNK* consequences for the other countries .
p483
aVThese countries must make greater efforts to strengthen their domestic markets and boost demand instead .
p484
aV*UNK* such as the unemployment rate and the *UNK* of poverty must be included in the Stability and Growth Pact .
p485
aVWhat is needed is to carry out a fundamental *UNK* rather than *UNK* its conditions .
p486
aVon behalf of the *UNK* Group .
p487
aV- Mr President , Commissioners - the three *UNK* if I may call you such - last session , Mr President , you had to *UNK* away .
p488
aVI think you had an urgent appointment .
p489
aVYou *UNK* my words of *UNK* and I am glad to see that you are here to receive them today because I feel I have some *UNK* to offer .
p490
aVYou are in such a *UNK* actually , are you not ?
p491
aVOne could almost feel sorry for you but of course , you know , you bring some of this on *UNK* .
p492
aVThe common currency *UNK* - which is an *UNK* that was *UNK* to failure ; I remember *UNK* at *UNK* *UNK* back in the *UNK* , *UNK* why it was deeply *UNK* and could not work and I gave it about 10 years and I am afraid it looks as though I was right - was *UNK* even by your own rule *UNK* .
p493
aVWhat in fact happened when you introduced it was that you actually *UNK* up your own rule *UNK* .
p494
aVYou *UNK* it away !
p495
aVYou welcomed every fiscal *UNK* economy into the *UNK* , including Greece - which was going to *UNK* the *UNK* of the *UNK* , and it thus comes as no *UNK* .
p496
aVI am not a *UNK* to the *UNK* of the euro .
p497
aVIt was always written in the *UNK* , as it were .
p498
aVTo suggest now that we have only just found out that Greece was *UNK* is *UNK* *UNK* .
p499
aVI was in the *UNK* at the time and we were *UNK* Greek *UNK* at 10 % *UNK* , they *UNK* to five and it was a *UNK* *UNK* - a bit like having the *UNK* of the *UNK* before the *UNK* had even started !
p500
aVOur commercial banks have got themselves into a terrible problem because they buy *UNK* debt .
p501
aVThey *UNK* *UNK* debt *UNK* at *UNK* A *UNK* .
p502
aVWhat are our central banks doing now ?
p503
aVThe very same thing .
p504
aVThey are *UNK* in the secondary market and *UNK* *UNK* *UNK* , *UNK* them as *UNK* A .
p505
aVThis is just how we got into this *UNK* to start with .
p506
aVIf you want to get out of this *UNK* , you need to get rid of the *UNK* support for commercial banks and get rid of central banks , which are actually part of the problem , not the solution .
p507
aV( FR ) Mr President , the Europe of the euro area is experiencing an economic decline without precedent in its history , the weakest growth in the world , the highest unemployment , and a continuing decline in competitiveness .
p508
aVThis total failure was made *UNK* to everyone during the recent sovereign debt crisis which affected Greece , and which will continue to affect Spain , Portugal , Italy and France , resulting in the general *UNK* of the populations of these countries .
p509
aVYou had promised the convergence and the harmonisation of the European countries .
p510
aVToday , you are *UNK* us towards a social and political *UNK* .
p511
aVYou alone bear the responsibility for this current tragedy , because by imposing a policy of a single , uniform and totalitarian monetary policy on economies which are so *UNK* , you have encouraged *UNK* speculation among some people and economic *UNK* among others .
p512
aVHow can we explain the fact that Spain , which had a budget *UNK* of 2 % in 2007 , is today experiencing a deficit of 12 % , if it is not because the single and uniform interest rates of the ECB have encouraged unprecedented real *UNK* speculation in this country , which today is covered with *UNK* *UNK* ?
p513
aVThe *UNK* of the European banking sector is effectively *UNK* by this new *UNK* crisis , the consequences of which are causing great fear .
p514
aVYour only response is to propose that we *UNK* in this error , though you have been wrong on everything , by continuing the *UNK* by the European Union and increasing its powers through *UNK* control of the national budgets , and by imposing on the European people an unprecedented *UNK* policy .
p515
aV*UNK* *UNK* *UNK* , *UNK* *UNK* - to *UNK* is human , to *UNK* is of the *UNK* .
p516
aVPresident of the Commission .
p517
aV- Mr President , I will try to respond to some of the concrete questions .
p518
aVFirst of all , to *UNK* *UNK* , thank you for your support .
p519
aVIn fact , we believe this will enhance the credibility of our Stability and Growth Pact , but also of the euro and of the European project as a whole , and we believe that Parliament should be closely associated with all these efforts .
p520
aVAt the last European Council , when President *UNK* was there , I made a point that Parliament should be kept fully informed of progress in the discussions on the future economic governance of Europe .
p521
aVI think that some of the concerns expressed by Mr Hughes and Mr *UNK* should be considered , but in fact , I believe that our proposal does consider your concerns because in this proposal , we are saying something new : that the Stability and Growth Pact is not everything , that we are linking analysis of the implementation of the measures in the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact with macro-economic imbalances , with the problems of *UNK* in competitiveness .
p522
aVSo , in fact , what we are proposing is a *UNK* approach that does not look only to the macro-economic aspects but also to growth , as *UNK* *UNK* was *UNK* , that looks also to innovation , to the reforms .
p523
aVThat is precisely our goal with Youth 2020 .
p524
aVAnd yes , Mr *UNK* , as you rightly mention , we are concerned now with the internal market and we are working on this taking the report presented by *UNK* *UNK* - a report I have asked him to present - as a basis and Commissioner Barnier will come in the *UNK* with some very important proposals , a Single Market Act in fact to address this issue .
p525
aVSo our proposal is not only about *UNK* in macro-economic aspects .
p526
aVToday we are discussing economic governance , so it is natural that we look at what did not go well , but I want to underline this point - this is not just about macro-economic *UNK* : it is also about growth and about our reform agenda .
p527
aVWhat is new here is that now , for the first time - if , of course , this plan can in the end be agreed - we have this comprehensive approach , trying to look at all the aspects .
p528
aVYou will remember that , when I presented the Europe 2020 strategy some months ago , in some *UNK* in Europe some people were saying *UNK* , you can not link it to the Stability and Growth Pact because it may *UNK* the Stability and Growth Pact ' .
p529
aVI think that everybody agrees now that discussing the macro-economic *UNK* without discussing structural reform , and without considering competitiveness , makes no sense .
p530
aVThat is why I also do not agree with the idea that our approach is not balanced .
p531
aVIn Youth 2020 , we were fighting for targets such as reduction of poverty , education , and employment to be included .
p532
aVSo it is , in fact , a very balanced approach , one in which we try to *UNK* all the economic policy instruments , to have a European dimension and a national dimension and to have , at the same time , objectives related to competitiveness and objectives related to social inclusion and to education .
p533
aVYou are right , Mr *UNK* ; it is up to the Commission to make the proposals , and that is what we are doing .
p534
aVWe will come with formal proposals .
p535
aVWhat is going on is a very important reform .
p536
aVThat is why *UNK* *UNK* is also giving his very important input on behalf of the Commission to the task force .
p537
aVWe believe it is important to bring some consensus , because these are very important changes , but of course , when the time comes to present the legislative proposals to the Commission , we will do so , and that is exactly the best way to have your Parliament associated .
p538
aVBut we also want to include in this *UNK* approach macro-economic surveillance with *UNK* .
p539
aVIt is not only about sanctions for those who do not fulfil the criteria of depth and the deficit .
p540
aVWe will also try to reinforce coordination in terms of the macro-economic imbalances .
p541
aVSome of you also mentioned supervision , and , once again , I would like to remind you that our aim remains to have the new authority in place at the start of 2011 .
p542
aVWe need this since our whole reform is based on this new *UNK* .
p543
aVIn the last few days , a new Belgian Presidency has renewed momentum towards a deal .
p544
aVThere is a *UNK* sense of constructive *UNK* on both sides .
p545
aVI am grateful for the ambition Parliament has been demonstrating .
p546
aVI am grateful for your strong support .
p547
aVAt the same time , I would like to ask you to continue your efforts to reach a satisfactory deal in the next few days .
p548
aVI believe it now appears within *UNK* .
p549
aVThe Commission has contributed through various compromise texts and is very pleased that progress is being made .
p550
aVWe now call on both *UNK* to maintain the positive dynamic .
p551
aVAs Mrs *UNK* said , and she is right , the Americans have announced the political agreement but they have not yet *UNK* .
p552
aV*UNK* when you read the press , it appears that the Americans are much more advanced than we are .
p553
aVIt is not true .
p554
aVPresident *UNK* said in the G20 that he got a *UNK* agreement .
p555
aV*UNK* , and we welcome that .
p556
aVBut in reality , we should be able to conclude our legislative work long before our American partners and I believe we should do that to show also our leadership in terms of the financial regulation and supervision at the global level .
p557
aVThat could only enhance the role of Europe in this matter .
p558
aVFinally , some of you spoke about stress *UNK* .
p559
aVAs you know , the Commission is playing an important role in promoting transparency and *UNK* the results of the ongoing stress *UNK* of banks .
p560
aVAt the last European Council , I made a strong *UNK* to make the results public .
p561
aVAs you know , this is a national competence , but I am indeed extremely pleased with the European Council agreement to do so .
p562
aVThis decision should *UNK* *UNK* by either *UNK* *UNK* suspicion or by dealing with the remaining problems that may exist .
p563
aVI am very *UNK* about the overall *UNK* of the EU banking industry , but we must identify possible *UNK* of *UNK* and deal with them .
p564
aVA fully transparent stress test provides the opportunity to do so .
p565
aV*UNK* mechanisms must be designed for *UNK* in case of need and this is , once again , a national responsibility .
p566
aVIf state intervention is needed , this will be examined by the Commission in a *UNK* manner under the Community State aid rules .
p567
aVThe European decision to *UNK* individual results of bank stress *UNK* was indeed very well received by the G20 leaders in *UNK* last weekend and we believe this is the way to restore confidence in our overall system .
p568
aVSo , as you see , we are acting on several *UNK* .
p569
aVToday , I have presented to you the proposals made more recently in terms of economic governance , but we should not separate those proposals from the other efforts that we are pursuing to give more coherence to our economic policy , to understand that a monetary union without some kind of economic coordination does not make sense .
p570
aVI believe that the stability of the euro is in the interest of all our citizens .
p571
aVIt is in the interest , certainly , of the euro area , but it is also in the interest of all the European Union and of all those who want open markets , open economies and open societies .
p572
aV( Applause ) President *UNK* , thank you for your approach and for your cooperation with the European Parliament .
p573
aVThe debate is closed .
p574
aVWritten statements ( Rule *UNK* ) in writing .
p575
aV- I welcome the proposals made by the Commission .
p576
aVI can give an *UNK* that we , in the *UNK* and EP , are ready to work with you and the Council on this .
p577
aVEurope is about mutual and close *UNK* .
p578
aVThe current crisis demonstrates how important it is to know more about the challenges and worries the other members experience and to be prepared for common actions .
p579
aVThe proposed coordination and control mechanisms are needed , taking into account both the European dimension and specific *UNK* of each Member State .
p580
aVHowever , control mechanisms are not a solution but just a means .
p581
aVThey should not be *UNK* .
p582
aVThe solution is in more efficient work , *UNK* and innovation .
p583
aVThe key to the solution is prevention .
p584
aVSpecial attention should be paid to budgetary *UNK* and the state *UNK* .
p585
aVInstead of *UNK* financial control into smaller *UNK* , monitoring of the macro-economic situation as a whole is needed .
p586
aVThe new *UNK* system of incentives and sanctions deserves support .
p587
aVI also encourage making better use of Eurostat .
p588
aV*UNK* and *UNK* data is a crucial component to making the right decisions .
p589
aVI encourage the Council to show political will on the measures proposed , so that we can proceed to the practical implementation phase .
p590
aVI should like to draw fellow Members ' attention to the problem of national *UNK* .
p591
aVThe tax system can not serve solely as a means of *UNK* revenue ; it must also regulate and *UNK* economic development and guarantee the social protection of the population .
p592
aVThe tax system in Latvia is targeted at one result only - how to *UNK* revenue today by any means possible .
p593
aVIt seems that the *UNK* of *UNK* of the Republic of Latvia has no care for what will happen tomorrow .
p594
aVThe programme being followed by the *UNK* Government could , in a year 's time , lead to a situation in which the number of taxpayers will be *UNK* reduced and the level of unemployment will significantly increase , resulting in enormous social costs .
p595
aVThis is all the result of *UNK* and *UNK* tax legislation .
p596
aVIn individual cases , tax authority *UNK* can apply this *UNK* ' legislation in any way they choose .
p597
aVThis has led to the *UNK* of many businesses and commercial structures .
p598
aVWe must urgently set up a committee , a group of experts , charged with an evaluation of the *UNK* tax system .
p599
aVWhat is happening in the tax sphere in Latvia today can be described in one word - *UNK* !
p600
aVIn essence , the state is *UNK* *UNK* of their *UNK* funds .

p606
aVrapporteur .
p607
aV- ( *UNK* ) Mr President , Commissioner , Mr *UNK* , ladies and gentlemen , first I wish to thank all parties for their excellent levels of cooperation whilst this report was being produced .
p608
aVIt was not easy finding a solution that would satisfy everyone , and I understand that some people are still hoping for some changes , but we have achieved a unanimous result in committee .
p609
aVIt seems appropriate to move forward from here .
p610
aVThere were four issues relating to the role of *UNK* .
p611
aVThese were access to documents , the *UNK* of officials , information on criminal cases , and cooperation in the field of human rights .
p612
aVThere was also a fifth issue in the European *UNK* 's original proposal , his or her power to intervene , but this was *UNK* and right at the end of the discussion the *UNK* said that he wanted to withdraw it .
p613
aVThe most important amendment concerns the obligation of the EU institutions and bodies also to grant the *UNK* access to classified information and sensitive documents , if *UNK* necessary for the *UNK* to do his or her job .
p614
aV*UNK* *UNK* now the institutions have had the right to refuse to *UNK* information .
p615
aVThis will now be the subject of objective , and no longer *UNK* or arbitrary , consideration .
p616
aVThis is an important , *UNK* small , step in the right direction .
p617
aVThe institutions *UNK* classified information or documents to the *UNK* must inform the *UNK* of their classified status .
p618
aVFurthermore , for the rules to be implemented , the *UNK* may agree with the relevant institutions the operational conditions for access to classified information or other information covered by the obligation of professional *UNK* .
p619
aVThe role of the European *UNK* has become more important over the years for the European Union institutions and the citizens of Europe .
p620
aVWith the Lisbon Treaty , the Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union will become legally binding , which will make the job of the *UNK* even more important .
p621
aVIn the future we will need to do more to ensure that the *UNK* has sufficient resources , that his or her Statute reflects the current times , that he or she *UNK* the information needed and that officials give him or her the right information .
p622
aVUnder the Charter of Fundamental Rights , every person has the right to have his or her affairs handled *UNK* , fairly and within a reasonable time by the institutions and bodies of the Union .
p623
aVThe resources therefore have to be in place so that citizens do not have to wait years for decisions and can also have confidence in the fact that the *UNK* will be in *UNK* of all the necessary information and that officials will tell him or her what they know instead of what they want to say .
p624
aVOtherwise there is no rule of law , something we are so *UNK* of talking about , even if the EU is not a state as such .
p625
aVWe ourselves should also comply with the rule of law ; only then can we expect others to .
p626
aV*UNK* of the Commission .
p627
aV- Mr President , it is now 14 years since this Parliament first adopted the European *UNK* Statute .
p628
aV*UNK* has happened since then .
p629
aVIt is therefore normal and appropriate that the *UNK* has taken the initiative to modify his *UNK* , and the Commission welcomes that .
p630
aVThe important thing is this .
p631
aVThe citizens must have confidence in the *UNK* 's capacity to conduct thorough and *UNK* *UNK* in alleged cases of *UNK* .
p632
aVSo the *UNK* needs clear , *UNK* and efficient rules for his important work .
p633
aV*UNK* from the beginning , the Commission has followed this initiative very closely , and we have had fruitful discussions with the *UNK* and Parliament 's rapporteur , Ms *UNK* .
p634
aVOur respective services have also had a lot of contact and cooperation .
p635
aVThe Commission welcomes the general line of this report , and I want to thank the chairman , Mr Leinen , and all committee members - in particular Ms *UNK* - for their work .
p636
aVFrom the Commission 's side , we will deliver our formal opinion very shortly after Parliament requires us to do so .
p637
aVToday I would like to briefly *UNK* our main *UNK* .
p638
aVThey have to do with four specific issues .
p639
aVFirst , the hearing of *UNK* ; secondly , access to *UNK* ; thirdly , *UNK* , and fourth , cooperation in the field of human rights .
p640
aVI will say very shortly a few words about each of these points .
p641
aVFirst , about the hearing of *UNK* .
p642
aVThe Commission agrees with Parliament 's amendment on the hearing of *UNK* , and the purpose of this provision was to recall that officials give *UNK* not on a personal basis , but in their official capacity .
p643
aVWe are *UNK* that the current wording could give the impression that officials might act under *UNK* and not give *UNK* and complete evidence .
p644
aVThis has never happened , but I agree that it is important to modify the wording to avoid *UNK* .
p645
aVSecondly , on access to *UNK* , the Commission is in favour of allowing the *UNK* to consult documents that he needs in the course of his *UNK* .
p646
aVThe *UNK* has proposed to *UNK* the *UNK* exception for access to a *UNK* .
p647
aVThe Commission has never used this exception , but it is important that we are very clear .
p648
aVThe treatment of classified information has to be carefully considered .
p649
aVThe same goes for privacy of individuals , protection of proceedings and business *UNK* .
p650
aVThat is why the Commission welcomes Parliament 's amendment that , where these kinds of documents are concerned , the *UNK* should use rules which are strictly equivalent to those in force in the institution concerned .
p651
aVWith regard to sensitive information , such as data protection and business *UNK* , the Commission fully shares Parliament 's views .
p652
aVThis also goes for documents relating to proceedings in *UNK* .
p653
aVThis means that the *UNK* should apply the relevant Community law when dealing with requests from third parties for access to documents obtained by the *UNK* in the course of his *UNK* .
p654
aVAs you know , the relevant Community law - Regulation ( EC ) No *UNK* - is currently being *UNK* and the Commission will take a decision in just a few weeks time .
p655
aVFor these reasons , the Commission agrees with the aim of the amendments on access to documents , but we think maybe a more precise wording would improve the text even more , and we will come back to that when we present our formal opinion .
p656
aVThe third point , on *UNK* : when it comes to the transmission of information on possible criminal activities , the Commission entirely agrees with Parliament that the *UNK* should be able to *UNK* the European *UNK* Office of any information on matters within its remit and it is not entirely clear that the proposed notion of *UNK* institutional body ' would cover *UNK* .
p657
aVA *UNK* *UNK* could improve the text even more .
p658
aVFinally , on cooperation in the field of human rights , the current *UNK* has proved to be a good basis for the European *UNK* to cooperate with national *UNK* and similar bodies in the Member States .
p659
aVThe Commission fully encourages this practice .
p660
aVIt brings the European institutions closer to its citizens .
p661
aVWith a tabled amendment , Parliament would like to *UNK* the scope of cooperation to other institutions for the promotion and protection of human and fundamental rights .
p662
aVAccording to Articles *UNK* and *UNK* of the Treaty , it is the Commission , as representative of the Community , which establishes all appropriate forms of cooperation with international organisations in general and with the Council of Europe in particular .
p663
aVThis is why the Commission considers that this proposal goes beyond the mandate given to the *UNK* by the Treaty .
p664
aVThis being said , the Commission would be open to an alternative wording , and I hope we will be able to strike the right balance between the *UNK* 's important working contacts and the Treaties that does not *UNK* on the Commission 's institutional *UNK* .
p665
aVSo these are the Commission 's *UNK* on the issues raised by Parliament 's amendments , and after the vote tomorrow we will prepare our opinion and start discussions with the Council .
p666
aVThis should be done quickly , since we want to facilitate an agreement on the *UNK* under the *UNK* presidency .
p667
aVMr President , ladies and gentlemen , the EU is undoubtedly going through a particularly difficult period of crisis in credibility .
p668
aVIs the EU , I wonder , democratically credible ?
p669
aVIndeed , for it to be so , it needs the *UNK* of its citizens , and this is becoming increasingly complex as Europe is enlarged .
p670
aVThere is always the common foundation on which we built Europe and on which our fellow citizens rely .
p671
aVIt is a system of values protecting their fundamental rights .
p672
aVThe need to communicate with European citizens is more pressing than ever .
p673
aVIt is *UNK* only when the EU receives their *UNK* of concern and *UNK* to convince them that the institutions are *UNK* to meet their expectations .
p674
aVCitizens do not trust us because they do not feel that we are promoting or even extending their rights .
p675
aVOur attempt has got to have a lasting effect , ladies and gentlemen .
p676
aVWe must monitor historical developments and the new requirements they give rise to .
p677
aVThe European *UNK* 's primary concern is to ensure the correct operation of the institutional bodies and organisation of the EU , *UNK* the confidence that citizens need to have in it .
p678
aVThe proposed changes in the rules of procedure *UNK* the Statute of the *UNK* *UNK* him effectively for this .
p679
aVOn behalf of the Committee on Petitions , we support them *UNK* .
p680
aVFinally , let me congratulate in particular the rapporteur responsible for this issue , Mrs *UNK* , for her *UNK* efforts to achieve a *UNK* acceptable report .
p681
aVon behalf of the PPE-DE Group .
p682
aV- ( PT ) The debate on the changes to the Statute of the *UNK* in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs was not easy .
p683
aVIt was a long and very controversial debate and the question at issue was essentially to decide whether extending the *UNK* 's powers was a *UNK* step .
p684
aVWe started from a clear *UNK* , that the role of each institution in a democratic culture must be well defined and there must be no confusion over these roles .
p685
aVThe clear definition and *UNK* distribution of roles is the only way to promote legitimacy , effectiveness and accountability of the institutions .
p686
aVIt was for this very reason that the *UNK* *UNK* his proposal for access to the Court of Justice .
p687
aVHowever , compromises were reached on data protection , access to secret *UNK* and cooperation with other institutions on fundamental rights .
p688
aVThe *UNK* will now have access to secret *UNK* but will not be allowed to *UNK* such information to third parties .
p689
aV*UNK* protection will follow European Union data protection rules .
p690
aVIt is clear that the *UNK* can work with other institutions on the issue of fundamental rights , and it seems to me there can be no other way of *UNK* .
p691
aVCooperation with institutions on the subject of fundamental rights makes explicit an *UNK* principle , given that fundamental rights form the foundations and aim of the European Union .
p692
aVHowever , the compromise reached in what was not an easy debate *UNK* what I think must be the inevitable conclusion on this issue : the *UNK* , as an institution , must always be clear that , when exercising his powers , he must do so in accordance with the criteria of need , *UNK* and proportionality , because these are the criteria of justice .
p693
aVMr President , European *UNK* , ladies and gentlemen - my *UNK* *UNK* colleagues , perhaps we have delayed a little in debating the improvement to the Statute of the European *UNK* .
p694
aVHowever , I think that in the end we are doing so at an appropriate moment , because now that the European Parliament is debating in citizens ' rights general , it is *UNK* with a new treaty on the operation of the EU and with a Charter of Fundamental Rights containing an article specific about the right of citizens to make complaints to the European Citizens ' *UNK* .
p695
aVI think it is therefore the right moment to debate the subject of the confidence of citizens in the EU bodies .
p696
aVLet me remind you that the European *UNK* is at the service of European citizens to help them combat *UNK* .
p697
aVI should like to add that it is high time for the European Parliament itself to show confidence both in its institutions and in the European *UNK* .
p698
aVI think that our debate about the changes started at the initiative of the current *UNK* contained two *UNK* , which we managed , I believe , to resolve in committee .
p699
aVThe first related to the subject of competences .
p700
aVSome people have said that we are giving too many competences to the European *UNK* , but this is not true .
p701
aVThis report attempts to supplement the existing institutional competences of the European *UNK* so that he can use them appropriately in all the areas which the rapporteur has spoken about .
p702
aVThe second misunderstanding was over the *UNK* of documents .
p703
aVThis particular report does not state what documents the public has access to .
p704
aVIt refers to the documents which the *UNK* may see and *UNK* down two clear rules : those documents which are sensitive , according to the regulation , may not be seen by anyone ; documents subject to the *UNK* regime must continue to be subject to it .
p705
aVIn conclusion , let me say that in the current circumstances it is very important for us to promote this report .
p706
aVon behalf of the *UNK* Group .
p707
aV- Mr President , this initiative is a *UNK* strengthening of the Statute of the *UNK* , and a signal of confidence in the way that Mr *UNK* and his *UNK* , Mr *UNK* , have exercised their functions .
p708
aVIt also reflects a change in the political climate since the *UNK* of the Office of the *UNK* , especially with respect to increased transparency .
p709
aVIt would be *UNK* absurd for us as a Parliament to decline to allow the *UNK* full access to documents on the grounds of *UNK* .
p710
aVPublic opinion would be bound to treat such a *UNK* with great *UNK* .
p711
aVI agree with Commissioner *UNK* that it would be splendid if we could conclude these *UNK* negotiations under the *UNK* presidency , so that we are properly prepared to face voters at the elections in spring 2009 .
p712
aVWe should be proud of these reforms , which I believe the entire Parliament will feel able to support .
p713
aVon behalf of the Verts/ALE Group .
p714
aV- ( ES ) Mr President , Mr *UNK* , the Greens want to strengthen the institution of *UNK* in order to increase public confidence in the European institutions .
p715
aVHow can we do this ?
p716
aVBy *UNK* that the *UNK* should have full access to all types of documents , including classified documents .
p717
aVMoreover , we are delighted that the *UNK* is to be able to hear the *UNK* of officials of the European institutions who are to be free of the *UNK* of having always to speak in accordance with the *UNK* of *UNK* in their administration .
p718
aVThat is important .
p719
aVIt is also important , as mentioned in the Treaty of Lisbon and in this report , for the *UNK* to have the power to intervene in cases before the Court of Justice , and we endorse the call made by the *UNK* for greater transparency in general , including in this House , as regards the finances of MEPs .
p720
aVThis is the second time that the European Parliament has proposed improvements to the Statute of the *UNK* .
p721
aVOn the last occasion , the Council *UNK* those improvements .
p722
aVI am *UNK* that this time the actual powers of the *UNK* have finally been clarified , and that we have genuinely created a means of increasing the confidence of the man in the *UNK* in the European institutions .
p723
aV( ES ) Mr President , some of my fellow Members here are going to say : what is happening today ?
p724
aV*UNK* we lost all sense ?
p725
aVA Committee on Constitutional Affairs item at ten to eleven at night ?
p726
aVWhat has happened , then ?
p727
aV*UNK* Mr Duff strike a *UNK* and *UNK* Mr Watson to the second row of the Liberal Group ?
p728
aVWhat did we do here in the People 's Party ?
p729
aVNo , all we did here was comply with the recommendation of the *UNK* Party on Parliamentary Reform , which says that , when there are only a few of us , we should try to meet together , if only to keep *UNK* and not feel alone .
p730
aV*UNK* though , Mr President , I believe that the meeting tonight deals with an important topic .
p731
aVI am very pleased that the *UNK* is here with us .
p732
aVThis is because , as Mrs *UNK* , Vice-President of the Commission , so rightly said , after a *UNK* of operation , it is normal and right to stand back and look at what is not working and what could be improved .
p733
aVThis is precisely what the report of Mrs *UNK* aims to do and I would like to thank her for working so well with us all , and for seeking a consensus which demonstrates that , here in the European institutions , we live in a *UNK* and not a *UNK* democracy .
p734
aVSo , congratulations , Mrs *UNK* .
p735
aVWhat we have tried to achieve , Mr President , is something very simple .
p736
aVWhen the position of *UNK* was created by the Treaty of Maastricht , we were at an important *UNK* between a basically economic Union and an *UNK* political Union .
p737
aVThe *UNK* was a key element in that transition .
p738
aVToday we want to continue to support the *UNK* in his work so that he can continue to be a vital *UNK* in this *UNK* between the institutions and European citizens .
p739
aVI am therefore convinced that the reforms proposed - by consensus , I would repeat - by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs will go in that direction .
p740
aVAt the next *UNK* session we will debate the report of Mr *UNK* , who is dealing with another important aspect , transparency in the European institutions .
p741
aVBoth reports are leading in the same direction , Mr President , and show that here , even at five to eleven at night , we are concerning ourselves with our citizens .
p742
aVMr President , the European institutions are *UNK* more distant from citizens than are national or local institutions .
p743
aVThat is why we have the principle of subsidiarity , which states that we should not act at European level if national or local action is perfectly adequate .
p744
aVThat is also why we have an institutional system such that when we do act at European level we can offer citizens the guarantee that the institutions operate to the highest degree of openness , democracy and *UNK* .
p745
aVThat is why we have a European Parliament , so that Europe is not just left to government ministers and *UNK* , *UNK* and *UNK* .
p746
aVThat is why we have the Court of Justice , to ensure the rule of law .
p747
aVThat is also why we have the *UNK* , so that even those citizens who do not follow our *UNK* week in , week out - and there are many of them - can rest assured that we operate to those high standards , and that if there are allegations of *UNK* then they will be properly and *UNK* *UNK* .
p748
aVHowever , as Commissioner *UNK* said , citizens must have confidence in the *UNK* 's capacity to do that .
p749
aVEven if there have not yet been any cases of officials , when *UNK* by the *UNK* , having been given *UNK* from *UNK* ' *UNK* to *UNK* , and even if there have not up to now been problems of access to *UNK* documents , it is important that our citizens see that these things can not become obstacles , and can not be used as *UNK* to hide things from the *UNK* .
p750
aVThat is why I welcome the initiative the *UNK* has taken in proposing changes to his *UNK* .
p751
aVMy group will be supporting the changes approved by the Constitutional Affairs Committee , and I am sure that Parliament as a whole will endorse them *UNK* .
p752
aV( *UNK* ) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur *UNK* *UNK* for that fact that since the Lisbon Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights were signed a new framework on the *UNK* 's role in modern social relations has been proposed .
p753
aVI am *UNK* that this document will contribute to the more efficient execution of his duty and will make him an actual *UNK* of effective protection for European citizens against cases of bad governance on the part of European institutions Both our discussions and the report focus on the sensitive topic of the *UNK* 's access to information , including classified information .
p754
aVIn my opinion , if the *UNK* 's work is to be done effectively and if we are to ensure the best possible result in the *UNK* into objective truth , which is primarily in the public interest , European institutions should have the obligation to provide access to any type of information .
p755
aVAt the same time , however , the *UNK* must be informed of the type of such information , especially in cases where it is *UNK* .
p756
aVIndeed , it is very important to respect citizens ' privacy , particularly when using classified information .
p757
aVI think that the rapporteur has managed to strike a balance between personal rights and public interest .
p758
aVThis provides the *UNK* with access to the entire information on a given case , so that he or she can rule on it while at the same time there is compliance with all rules which are followed also by those institutions providing such information , and this will ensure both the protection of the information involved and the protection of European citizens ' rights .
p759
aV*UNK* the *UNK* 's role as a *UNK* between the European institutions and the citizens will make a contribution to the development of democracy and reinforce the principles of rule of law .
p760
aVThat is why it is very important that he or she is present not only at the European but at the national level as well , especially in countries where democratic principles and supervision are still in the process of being built and where government structures can not provide effective remedy for their citizens at the national level , yet those citizens are also citizens of the European Union .
p761
aVThat is why I would like to stress on the need to improve cooperation between the EU institutions and the *UNK* .
p762
aV*UNK* between the *UNK* and Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament are particularly important ; they need to cooperate in the interest of European citizens .
p763
aVIt is also important to develop and implement a more effective system of practical mechanisms for cooperation .
p764
aV( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs *UNK* 's report comes at a very important time in the process of European integration : the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights .
p765
aVThe *UNK* , for the first time , of the right of the citizens of Europe to a good administration constitutes significant progress towards greater transparency and meets the need for the actions and the behaviour of Community bodies to comply not only with the rules in force but also with the expectations of the European *UNK* as regards a responsible , *UNK* and efficient administration .
p766
aVThe proposed changes would make it possible , during an investigation , to overcome any *UNK* on the part of the Community institutions to cooperate fully in the clarification of the facts .
p767
aVAny possible willingness to *UNK* over certain aspects of the truth by adopting *UNK* texts whose wording is open to *UNK* interpretation can not be *UNK* .
p768
aVThis allows an administration far too much *UNK* and increases its *UNK* powers in a disproportionate and unacceptable manner .
p769
aVThe *UNK* needs the confidence of the citizens who expect him to intervene *UNK* in the protection of their rights .
p770
aVHowever , he is also duty bound to respect the *UNK* of the information that he receives .
p771
aVFor this reason , I congratulate Mrs *UNK* for having struck an appropriate balance between these two requirements and for having proposed balanced solutions that strengthen the effectiveness of the role of the *UNK* as a moral authority and improve the transparency of the Community institutions , *UNK* , in the spirit of the new Charter , the right of every European citizen to good governance and a good administration .
p772
aVVice-President of the Commission .
p773
aV- Mr President , I wish to thank the honourable Members for this discussion and their remarks .
p774
aVMany Members have mentioned that this is an issue of *UNK* and also of *UNK* .
p775
aVThose two issues are linked , and I am sure that these reforms will remove the *UNK* that institutions might , on occasion , have used to hide behind .
p776
aVThe reforms will *UNK* and open up procedures and ensure greater clarity and transparency , which is necessary in these times and in order to meet citizens ' expectations .
p777
aVI would like to take this opportunity to thank Ms *UNK* once again for working in an open and constructive way with us , and for informing us on her work .
p778
aVI would also like to thank the *UNK* himself , because I have had the opportunity to follow his work , and am aware of the level of *UNK* , seriousness and commitment with which he *UNK* out his tasks .
p779
aVIt has really *UNK* me , and I have great confidence in him .
p780
aVBy this initiative we are also helping the *UNK* *UNK* his *UNK* with what we would expect from the *UNK* in his examination of cases of *UNK* within our institutions .
p781
aVrapporteur .
p782
aV- ( *UNK* ) Mr President , I just want to thank everyone for their excellent cooperation and at this final review stage I hope that we will find the right wording so that there is greater confidence as a result of EU acts , that there will be adequate resources in place and that the *UNK* can be provided with all necessary information .
p783
aVIf not , as I said , it will be a bad day for the rule of law and for transparency , although I believe that a common view will be found , because now there are only a few *UNK* changes to make .
p784
aVThe debate is closed .
p785
aVThe vote will take place on *UNK* , 22 April 2008 .
p786
aV*UNK* of acts adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure : see Minutes Petitions : see Minutes 19 .
p787
aVEuropean Protection *UNK* ( Mr President , I have asked for the floor to remind you of the importance of today 's vote in order to send a clear message to the Council , aimed at the countries that have still not *UNK* themselves with security in this field .
p788
aVI believe that today , we have an opportunity to defend victims and ensure that they can live without fear and in freedom .
p789
aVIt is very important , not only for women , but also for men , children , victims of terrorism , victims of organised crime , victims of trafficking of women and for victims in general .
p790
aVMr President , there are two of us who are rapporteurs .
p791
aVI just want to remind the liberal ministers of the European Union that currently , it is also very important that this report is endorsed in order to support the fundamental rights of women .
p792
aVIt is in the hands of a liberal *UNK* , but also of other governments that have so far not signed up to it .
p793
aVWe will see if they support this initiative now .
p794
aV*UNK* and *UNK* of *UNK* imbalances - *UNK* of excessive deficit procedure - *UNK* for budgetary *UNK* of Member States - Budgetary surveillance in euro area - *UNK* of budgetary positions and surveillance and coordination of economic policies - *UNK* measures to correct excessive *UNK* imbalances in euro area ( continuation of debate ) The next item is the debate on prevention and *UNK* of *UNK* imbalances ; excessive deficit procedure ; requirements for budgetary *UNK* of Member States ; budgetary surveillance in the euro area ; surveillance of budgetary positions and surveillance and coordination of economic policies ; and enforcement measures to correct excessive *UNK* imbalances in the euro area .
p795
aV( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , our citizens want a strong and effective European Union .
p796
aV*UNK* , *UNK* and a purely intergovernmental vision are *UNK* the impact of the crisis and weakening the credibility of the European project .
p797
aVWe are not facing problems that are purely national , or a crisis that is only economic ; we are facing a political crisis that requires a swift , full , *UNK* response .
p798
aVThe basic concepts of *UNK* ' and *UNK* ' in the Economic and Monetary Union must be strengthened .
p799
aVThe proposal presented today on economic governance must be considerably improved if we are going to achieve that .
p800
aVWe are in favour of creating national budgetary *UNK* that guarantee transparency , economic coordination and verification of compliance with European commitments .
p801
aVWe believe it is necessary to correct *UNK* imbalances and move *UNK* convergence , and we find that the *UNK* report makes particular progress in that area .
p802
aVHowever , the proposals to reform the Stability and Growth Pact are *UNK* : they *UNK* stability with adjustment , and they *UNK* growth policies to the market and the national sphere .
p803
aV*UNK* Europe 's commitment to investment and employment is not acceptable .
p804
aVWe will not be *UNK* in this attempt to make Europe turn its back on its citizens and its own interests ; we are not resigned to *UNK* *UNK* the way in which our problems are getting worse ; and we do not accept double standards .
p805
aVWe need unanimity to provide resources and qualified majority decisions to avoid penalties .
p806
aVWe must *UNK* our commitment to Europe and do it quickly .
p807
aVThe European Parliament should work hard to make an ambitious , *UNK* response worthy of our citizens .
p808
aVWe need to move *UNK* , not *UNK* like *UNK* .
p809
aVEurope must not hide when it is needed most .
p810
aVMr President , although the United Kingdom is not a member of the euro zone - and I hope it never will be - we have a *UNK* interest in its success .
p811
aVI wish the euro zone well and I regret that I am unable to support the proposals on economic governance we are debating tonight .
p812
aVThe proposals before us grant the Commission *UNK* new powers .
p813
aV*UNK* these powers been limited to euro zone countries alone , I would not have *UNK* , but instead we see the Commission and many Members in this Parliament - including Ms *UNK* , for whom I have the utmost respect - using the crisis in the euro zone as an excuse to extend the power of the EU into the economic governance of the United Kingdom and other countries who do not use the euro .
p814
aVI was not elected to grant the EU more powers over the way the United Kingdom *UNK* its affairs and I shall therefore vote against these proposals .
p815
aV( DE ) Mr President , the debate reflects the *UNK* issues of economic policy in Europe .
p816
aVWhilst we have a central monetary policy , there is local responsibility for budgetary and finance policies .
p817
aVThe attempts by some Greek Members to shift the responsibility for Greece 's internal political competence *UNK* Europe , or to third parties , to capitalist banks , or to *UNK* , can only be a mistake .
p818
aV( *UNK* ) It was the Greek *UNK* .
p819
aVFortunately , the euro is stable both *UNK* and *UNK* .
p820
aVWhat we are dealing with is not a crisis of the euro , but rather a sovereign debt crisis .
p821
aVThat is where we must start .
p822
aVIt is *UNK* - even the state can not live beyond its means *UNK* .
p823
aVIt is *UNK* adding further debt to existing *UNK* without *UNK* the consequences of necessary reforms .
p824
aVThat is why I say it is high time that we acted .
p825
aVParliament has been calling for measures for a long time .
p826
aVThe Commission has now proposed that the Stability and Growth Pact be *UNK* up .
p827
aVThe Hungarian Presidency has negotiated well , as has our side .
p828
aVI actually think it a pity , Mr *UNK* - for on many aspects of regulation of the financial markets we are very much in agreement - that the *UNK* still want to *UNK* between good and bad debt .
p829
aVThat is the wrong way to go .
p830
aVWhen we draw up the balance *UNK* to see which countries of Europe have got into difficulties there is no need to *UNK* anyone ; it is easy to see .
p831
aVThere were *UNK* governments everywhere that these budgetary and financial problems have arisen .
p832
aVHungary , Latvia , Romania , outside the euro area , Ireland , Spain , Portugal , the United Kingdom and Greece too , apart from a break of four years , when our lot were in .
p833
aVIn other words , your economic model does not work .
p834
aV( *UNK* ) *UNK* , Mr *UNK* , you should know better by now .
p835
aVWe can not *UNK* the *UNK* of responsibility here and I will say quite *UNK* that the *UNK* were not the first to *UNK* the Stability and Growth Pact ; rather it was the two big ones , Germany and France .
p836
aVWe also *UNK* to that and changed it .
p837
aVYou were in the government at the time , Mr *UNK* .
p838
aVYou *UNK* the grave - it was your party that *UNK* the grave of the Stability and Growth Pact , not the *UNK* .
p839
aVNow , however , it is for the *UNK* to ... ( The President cut off the speaker . )
p840
aV( The speaker agreed to take two *UNK* questions under Rule *UNK* ( 8 ) of the Rules of Procedure ) ( DE ) Mr President , Mr *UNK* , I just want to make sure that you are familiar with our ideas .
p841
aVI am therefore asking you whether you are aware of what we proposed to your colleague , Mrs *UNK* , which was firstly that we strengthen the pact by including closer monitoring of *UNK* objectives proposed by Mr *UNK* from the *UNK* package , such as research and development and the fight against poverty .
p842
aVThis would also include investment in *UNK* energy supply systems .
p843
aV( FR ) Mr President , I have two points .
p844
aVFirst , Greece : let us not try to *UNK* history .
p845
aVThis was a *UNK* government which for two terms of office *UNK* the figures with the help of *UNK* *UNK* Bank .
p846
aVToday , a *UNK* government is trying to get things back into shape .
p847
aVIs it the people who should be paying for the mistakes made on the advice of banking *UNK* ?
p848
aVSecond example : in my country , Belgium , under a government with *UNK* participation led by our fellow Member Mr *UNK* , in 12 years we reduced our debt from *UNK* % of GDP to 80 % .

aV*UNK* by the banking community , and by *UNK* in particular , meant that we had to help out the banks in order to prevent the system ... ( The President cut off the speaker ) ( DE ) Mr President , I am very familiar with the proposals made by Mr *UNK* and the Group of the *UNK* Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament .
p850
aVThe only problem with them was that they primarily want more money .
p851
aVThe problem can not be solved by *UNK* more money at it .
p852
aVAs Mr *UNK* has just confirmed , there are opportunities for debt reduction even with *UNK* involvement .
p853
aVI want to *UNK* it out that the reforms that have taken place in Greece have done nothing to result in the large amount of private Greek wealth genuinely sharing the burden of the costs of the state .
p854
aVOn the contrary : since 1 January EUR *UNK* billion has been withdrawn from Greek bank *UNK* by Greek citizens , and since 1 January EUR 12 billion of Greek government *UNK* have been *UNK* .
p855
aVI am demanding that the many wealthy parties in Greece participate actively , and this must be regulated by policy .
p856
aVIf they can accept responsibility , then they will be able to benefit from our solidarity .
p857
aV( NL ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by paying tribute to all those who have been working hard on this package of late , but I also support the previous speakers from my group .
p858
aVTo us , this package is not sufficient and it is not balanced .
p859
aVThis is not so much a matter of technical detail , but of essence : what are we putting the emphasis upon ?
p860
aVWhat should be the objectives for a more integrated economic policy ?
p861
aVIt is therefore not true that we do not want European economic governance , but we do need to ask ourselves how we should define it , what the essence of European economic governance is .
p862
aVObviously , the current crisis has made it clear that a monetary union also requires economic cooperation .
p863
aVIt seems that some sort of design error has *UNK* into our financial *UNK* and we need to rectify that .
p864
aVFor us , this is about much more than just *UNK* to cuts and achieving budgetary objectives .
p865
aVYes , Mr *UNK* and ladies and gentlemen , we are indeed in favour of sound public finances , but what is key for us is how we can all move forward , how we can *UNK* out of this *UNK* .
p866
aVHow we can prepare for the future and , therefore , how we can create growth and employment through a common economic policy .
p867
aVIn other words , by integrating an ambitious investment strategy into the system , by *UNK* a link with the 2020 objectives , or to put it another way , by making joint arrangements , for example , to improve our education system , fight poverty and become more competitive and take on the competition from third countries through investment in research and development .
p868
aVBy the way , it *UNK* me that some members , as was the case with Mr *UNK* just yesterday , are advocating an investment strategy while being content with this package .
p869
aVFor me , personally , that is not consistent .
p870
aVWe therefore consider the *UNK* ' to be a *UNK* opportunity to put genuine economic governance in place .
p871
aV( NL ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are in a very deep crisis , and not only one from which we have to ensure that we *UNK* ourselves , but also one which we must prevent ourselves from ever *UNK* in again .
p872
aVIt is for that very reason that we need a strong legislative framework and for that very reason that we , as a *UNK* , as Parliament , also have to shoulder our responsibilities .
p873
aVAfter all , we are the generation that is currently *UNK* the future of our children .
p874
aVWe , in the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) have the courage to push through such a set of rules .
p875
aVWe must now have the courage to decide what action is needed .
p876
aVWe must also have the courage to choose to push such decisions through , to ensure they are complied with , even if that means we have to *UNK* against the tide .
p877
aVWe understand the people who are taking to the *UNK* to protest and , what is more , what we are doing is giving a precise structural answer to those people 's concerns : good jobs , sustainable growth and room in the future for an adequate social policy .
p878
aVIf we want to remain a relevant *UNK* in a *UNK* economy , then we have to ensure greater coordination between economic and budgetary policies , as well as greater coordination between the economic policy and the policy on the competitiveness of Member States .
p879
aVTo that end , we obviously need investment in the economy but what we need , first of all , is to ensure that no one is allowed the liberty to *UNK* from agreed rules without a valid reason , because that means *UNK* others into the *UNK* as well .
p880
aVThe package that eventually came out of the negotiations provides a strong answer to those requirements , and it also provides an answer to the mistakes of the past .
p881
aVThe only thing is - and this is *UNK* by our behaviour in the past - that we must further strengthen the *UNK* aspect of the Stability Pact , because if a Member State goes down the wrong road , then we can not allow it to become subject to political *UNK* in the Council , which is ultimately what the response from Europe will be .
p882
aVI therefore hope that we here will be *UNK* a vote in favour , that we will support this package , but also that we will give ourselves the opportunity to start a final round of negotiations with the Council in order to strengthen this point further .
p883
aV( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that we are witnessing a *UNK* .
p884
aVThe package that should correct and prevent imbalances and *UNK* is based on an *UNK* and a lack of *UNK* .
p885
aVIt is like a body that stands on two legs , but one is much longer and more developed than the other .
p886
aVThe *UNK* that controls fiscal policy is *UNK* and *UNK* , while the one that controls development policy , which should provide impetus and long-term drive , appears *UNK* and lacking in strength .
p887
aVI think that this *UNK* result in the final structure of the package is down to a difference of opinion about the *UNK* and nature of the crisis .
p888
aVThe difference between those who believe that *UNK* and imbalances in public finances are at the root of the crisis and those who think that the underlying problem has to do instead with the lack of rules and transparency in the markets , economic and trade imbalances and social inequality .
p889
aVWe risk confusing cause and effect .
p890
aVWe all want public finances to be controlled *UNK* , but the goal of reducing debt is not sufficient to *UNK* growth and competitiveness .
p891
aVThe main thrust of these measures lies in procedures and sanctions .
p892
aV*UNK* less emphasis - too little emphasis - has been placed on investment and sustainable growth strategy , which Europe should promote and implement .
p893
aVWe know that our actions can lead to *UNK* differing results , even without our *UNK* it , and can even have the opposite effect to the one we are seeking to achieve .
p894
aVThis is the *UNK* of purpose .
p895
aVI fear that this problem lies at the heart of this package .
p896
aV( ES ) Mr President , we are clearly in a serious situation that calls for all of us to be responsible .
p897
aVAll of us , including the Council .
p898
aVThe difference that *UNK* us today from the Council is the issue of reverse qualified majority voting .
p899
aVWe all know that the Stability and Growth Pact ( *UNK* ) has not worked because the Member States have decided not to *UNK* each other for any violation of budgetary discipline .
p900
aVPerhaps this is because they have read in the *UNK* the quote that says , *UNK* he who is without *UNK* cast the first *UNK* ' .
p901
aVWhat this Parliament wants - and this is what *UNK* it from the Council - is to put an end to this *UNK* *UNK* between governments , and replace a *UNK* *UNK* with an *UNK* one .
p902
aVThe package is good and deserves to be voted through .
p903
aVWhen times are hardest , no one would ever consider saying that we have to spend more .
p904
aVWhat we are now doing is *UNK* budgetary discipline .
p905
aVHowever , when something is good it is not necessarily enough .
p906
aVThe speeches we have heard today have shown several things .
p907
aVWe all knew that the *UNK* was not an optimum currency area .
p908
aVEveryone thought that the current institutional framework - a centralised monetary policy , a Stability and Growth Pact , and the coordination of the other economic policies - would enable the differences between Member States to be overcome , or at least reduced .
p909
aVThat has not been the case .
p910
aVIn the good times , their differences only increased ; in the bad times , the pillars on which the monetary union was established were left in *UNK* .
p911
aVThe *UNK* ' principle , the *UNK* ' principle , and now the *UNK* ' principle could also be out the window .
p912
aVWe now find ourselves in *UNK* 's *UNK* is to be done ? '
p913
aVsituation .
p914
aVThe only solution is to move forward on the issue of political union .
p915
aVI welcome the issue of *UNK* .
p916
aVIt is a positive step in that direction , but more needs to be done .
p917
aVIf establishing a political union requires reforming the Treaties by *UNK* a convention , so be it .
p918
aVThere is a Greek *UNK* that says , *UNK* are made for man , and not man for rules ' .
p919
aVIt is not a question of continuing *UNK* until three *UNK* in the morning or holding ministerial meetings at six *UNK* in the morning .
p920
aVFrom now on let us think about what can be done to remedy this situation .
p921
aVThe first step , however , is to vote in favour of this package , which is a good step in the right direction .
p922
aVOtherwise we will be making a *UNK* effort and , as Mr Ortega y *UNK* was just saying , *UNK* effort leads to *UNK* and - in politics - to opposition .
p923
aVIt leads to *UNK* and also to speaking for longer than the time one is allocated , Mr *UNK* y *UNK* , through the President 's *UNK* .
p924
aV( IT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this debate offers the opportunity to address the issue of a new agreement on governance in the European Union , to send a strong and *UNK* message , to restore solidarity to the EU and to *UNK* speculation .
p925
aVIt is a fact that in years gone by we have weakened the Stability and Growth Pact .
p926
aVAn equally *UNK* fact is that this was a mistake and we are paying the consequences .
p927
aVWe must go back to rules of fiscal discipline , and this is the real issue , the real debate that we must have among ourselves .
p928
aV*UNK* should be automatic so that we do not have the same *UNK* that we had with the old Stability and Growth Pact .
p929
aVI think that there is only one way to get out of the crisis ; there are no *UNK* .
p930
aVThe answer lies in national policies , in carrying out planned and agreed commitments .
p931
aV*UNK* between EU Member States must be accompanied by a sense of responsibility and must respect rules that Member States can not and must not *UNK* violate .
p932
aVClearly in all this we can not forget the importance of growth , which brings in internal revenue , and structural reforms to get *UNK* countries back on their *UNK* .
p933
aVStructural reforms aimed at *UNK* the competitiveness of economies and the potential for growth must be the priority on the political agenda .
p934
aVI disagree with those who argue that the new Stability and Growth Pact will prevent States from developing .
p935
aVRather , it will *UNK* them to clear out the *UNK* wood , to *UNK* , to undertake those structural reforms that are the *UNK* for *UNK* the economy .
p936
aVThanks to these and strict *UNK* to the rules established by the new Stability and Growth Pact , I am sure that the EU will gain in strength and will be able to face new challenges without assistance policies and , worse still , *UNK* *UNK* that lead *UNK* and do only damage , especially among the weakest members of society .
p937
aV( FR ) Mr President , the more Parliament *UNK* of the wonderful progress made on economic governance , the more I want to call on my fellow Members to show some *UNK* , because we are *UNK* on the *UNK* of the *UNK* .
p938
aVThere are two things to which we need to open our eyes .
p939
aVThe first is that the European Parliament has fallen silent during the Greek crisis .
p940
aVWe are usually so quick to react to all *UNK* of events all over the world , with one resolution after another , and yet this fundamental crisis seems to have left us *UNK* .
p941
aVI *UNK* the fact that we have been incapable of sending a strong , simple , practical message to the Greek people , to the Member State governments and to Europe 's citizens .
p942
aVThe second item relates to the scope of this package .
p943
aVIn voting for these six directives *UNK* regulations , as I hope we will , we will certainly be taking the euro area a step further , and I mean a step , nothing more , towards the kind of discipline that has been so lacking , and its value will be proven in the future .
p944
aVHowever , we only need to look at the *UNK* discussions around the *UNK* qualified majority voting system to see how far we still have to go , when it is rules and automatic sanctions we should be talking about .
p945
aVSome people still see the *UNK* qualified majority system as something to be *UNK* of .
p946
aVHowever , we must remain firm on this principle .
p947
aVFrom a strictly political point of view , I am disappointed that the *UNK* Members continue to reject the principles of good budget management , against all the evidence .
p948
aV*UNK* and sustainable growth can not go hand in hand .
p949
aVStates do need to manage their budgets according to good *UNK* rules , not by *UNK* through public expenditure , which is a short-term *UNK* but never a lasting solution .
p950
aVAs we approach these next few crucial weeks , our task is now to build new economic union ... ( The President cut off Mrs *UNK* ) ( Mrs *UNK* agreed to take a *UNK* question under Rule *UNK* ( 8 ) ) ( DE ) Mr President , since I have no speaking time left , I would ask Mrs *UNK* the following question : would you be prepared , Mrs *UNK* , to tell Parliament on my behalf that I did not mean all the Greek Members just now , but only the two *UNK* Members who spoke immediately before me , Mr *UNK* and Mr *UNK* ?
p951
aVWould you be prepared to confirm this to Parliament ?
p952
aV( DE ) Mr President , I am of course happy to say that and to confirm that .
p953
aVHowever , I should also like to say this : we are also addressing the *UNK* .
p954
aVIn Greece there are only 10 tax *UNK* who say that they *UNK* more than EUR 1 million per year .
p955
aVI am addressing them too , just as Mr *UNK* addressed the *UNK* .
p956
aV( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , time is running out .
p957
aVTherefore , I would like to call for an end to the *UNK* speeches , the *UNK* and the party political *UNK* , regardless of where these things are taking place .
p958
aVWe need to do the job properly and to respond to the crisis on a *UNK* basis .
p959
aVWhat are the causes of the crisis ?
p960
aVWe have constantly been emphasising the fact that the causes include a failure to comply with the rules , the *UNK* of sanctions and the lack of progress on taking the monetary union to the next stage .
p961
aVWith our plans for economic governance , we are now calling for the Stability and Growth Pact to be strengthened , both in terms of *UNK* and *UNK* measures , for a majority in favour of the implementation of sanctions and for the Commission to have the right to intervene , when necessary , so that the citizens of Europe can rely on the rules being followed .
p962
aVMy second point is that we want the monetary union to be taken to the next stage .
p963
aVThis means establishing the economic union and not losing sight of the goal of political union .
p964
aVI have to say that I am disappointed by the results of the *UNK* .
p965
aVIt is not functioning properly at the moment .
p966
aVHowever , the fact that we do not have the Council 's agreement in the dialogue on economic policy and that the European Parliament and the two sides of industry are involved in this is reducing our ability to become more integrated .
p967
aVWe want to increase our levels of integration .
p968
aVBecause the Council is not able to address the current *UNK* in our society and to give Parliament the opportunity of making the ministers from the Member States directly accountable to us , the results of the *UNK* are being weakened .
p969
aVWe stand by these results .
p970
aVWe want to resolve the open issues and bring about integration .
p971
aVIf we allow our position to be weakened because of the *UNK* of the Council , we have not learned any lessons from the crisis .
p972
aV( The speaker agreed to take a *UNK* question under Rule *UNK* ( 8 ) of the Rules of Procedure ) ( DE ) Mr President , I would like to ask Mr Karas a question .
p973
aVWe are in the *UNK* of a crisis in the single currency .
p974
aVWe have discovered that we have fundamental problems , such as the lack of a common fiscal and economic policy .
p975
aVThese *UNK* by the *UNK* and the *UNK* are quite surprising to me .
p976
aVDo you really believe , Mr Karas , that no one was aware before the introduction of the single currency of the *UNK* that common governance and political union are also needed ?
p977
aVPerhaps no one was quite *UNK* or *UNK* enough to tell the citizens of Europe this .
p978
aV( DE ) Mr President , of course , everyone knew that and they said so .
p979
aVThey said that monetary union is a political project , that the integration involved in monetary union is *UNK* and that monetary union must be followed by the next steps towards integration .
p980
aVWe have been heavily committed to this for years .
p981
aV*UNK* groups like *UNK* have *UNK* up feelings against the European Union , have said very little about the importance of the currency and the opportunity , the political will ... ( The President cut off the speaker ) ( RO ) Mr President , I am going to vote tomorrow on the legislative package on European economic governance .
p982
aVI would also like to thank in particular the rapporteurs , the Hungarian Presidency and the Commission for their really exceptional efforts , *UNK* in the clarification of this legislative package .
p983
aVThis European economic governance package must be viewed in connection with the other legislative package on the financial sector , including Europe 's financial supervision structure , which has already been adopted .
p984
aVI firmly believe that effective implementation of this legislation will ensure that no other Member State will ever again be exposed when faced with a future crisis .
p985
aVWe will be able to prevent and *UNK* fiscal and economic imbalances , which is one of the best guarantees of economic growth and jobs .
p986
aVHowever , I must express my concern that European institutions are *UNK* to acknowledge the economic reality with which we are currently faced .
p987
aVBy this I mean that a Member State that has a debt which it can no longer pay can not receive assistance , thereby adding a new debt to the existing one , with higher costs as well .
p988
aVWe have learnt from experience and common sense that the solution lies in the *UNK* country putting its house in order , with the *UNK* *UNK* that the debt to be paid needs to be *UNK* to match the relevant country 's real ability to pay .
p989
aVIf we are not going to proceed in this manner , far from *UNK* time , we will waste time and the problem will get worse .
p990
aV( PL ) Mr President , after listening *UNK* to today 's debate , I should like to make a few comments , if I may .
p991
aVFirstly , reference has been made very frequently in this Chamber to *UNK* of the economy by means of additional budgetary expenditure .
p992
aVI think that the Members concerned are forgetting that there are countries in the European Union - and not just one or two , and not only Greece - which have domestic debt of over 100 % , the *UNK* cause of which is *UNK* of the economy .
p993
aVAs a result , we have achieved a certain level of economic growth , *UNK* somewhat *UNK* growth , but we have been left with the *UNK* to pay , and we have to pay them now .
p994
aVThere was talk of restrictive solutions in respect of limiting the deficit .
p995
aVYet the proposed solutions state that each country is to reduce debt to 60 % within 20 years .
p996
aVIf 20 years to *UNK* debt is the long-term perspective , what is the short-term perspective ?
p997
aVI can not imagine a *UNK* perspective in this situation .
p998
aVIs it possible to abandon penalties , or is the penalty system a restrictive system ?
p999
aV*UNK* years ago , when I was still a student , I learnt about the convergence criteria , and their mandatory nature .
p1000
aVYet they were only mandatory criteria on paper .
p1001
aVIf they were mandatory for anyone , it was only for those who *UNK* to join the euro area , and they were not mandatory for anyone in the euro area .
p1002
aVIn view of the above , such a system can not be successfully introduced without penalties , and without restrictive penalties , as some have said .
p1003
aVThese sanctions *UNK* on paper , but , as we remember and as we know , there have been no real sanctions to date .
p1004
aVMy last comment relates to the fact that members of the Group of the *UNK* Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have said that we should implement the 2020 strategy , and not merely cut spending .
p1005
aVYet these very documents talk about a European *UNK* , among other things .
p1006
aVThey also introduce a new procedure for excessive imbalances .
p1007
aVOne of the features of this instrument is that it gives the European Commission influence over whether the Member States are implementing the 2020 strategy or not , and so it is worth telling the truth .
p1008
aVI would urge you to adopt this package , for a lack of agreement between the Council , the Commission and Parliament on this issue will ... ( The President cut off the speaker ) Mr President , compromise is *UNK* .
p1009
aVCertainly the Parliament in its negotiations has gone more than *UNK* towards a compromise , but I think we have reached the limit .
p1010
aV*UNK* decision-making on the package does not solve the problem .
p1011
aVThe problem will not go away .
p1012
aVThe same problems will face us again and will threaten the whole future of the euro and the EU if we do not have better coordination and more Community method .
p1013
aVIn the long run the EU is an economic union .
p1014
aVWe need to get to the core reasons for the problems .
p1015
aVWe are closer with this package , but we are still not close enough .
p1016
aVI think that the reverse qualified majority is one of the issues at the core of the problem .
p1017
aVThis is not a time for *UNK* and *UNK* *UNK* , which , in my view , the Council has been doing to some extent sometimes .
p1018
aVThe Council , like Parliament , is responsible for Europeans .
p1019
aVI hope that the Council , with the Commission and Parliament , will share their responsibility and take the necessary steps on this economic governance package and future actions .
p1020
aVIf the *UNK* are not right and not in order , plans for the future and the *UNK* are only *UNK* and *UNK* words , on which basis we really can not build the future .
p1021
aV( DE ) Mr President , the European economic governance package sends out a clear signal that we must avoid debt crises wherever possible in future .
p1022
aVWe must take effective measures to prevent the euro from being *UNK* .
p1023
aVThat is the basic message of this excellent report produced by Mrs *UNK* .
p1024
aVIn order to achieve this , we need greater political coordination between the Member States and strong supervision at an EU level .
p1025
aVThis supervision is an essential element of the Europe 2020 strategy .
p1026
aVWe must finally make consistent use of the Stability and Growth Pact , which forms the basis for the strong euro , in order to show the Member States with high budget *UNK* where the limits are .
p1027
aVThis is what the citizens of Europe are *UNK* calling for and not only in the countries which are supposed to be showing solidarity in the form of constantly growing rescue *UNK* .
p1028
aVWe must not allow any more *UNK* or *UNK* compromises to be made when the Member States *UNK* their convergence programmes and budget policies to one another .
p1029
aVThe citizens will only be prepared to accept painful reforms if they are shown a clear picture of the situation , so that they can give their support to the necessary measures .
p1030
aVIn contrast to the *UNK* held *UNK* in *UNK* , we do not need less Europe , but more .
p1031
aVFor example , we should strengthen our Community method which is based on the Treaty of Lisbon .
p1032
aVThe Commission must and will accept its responsibilities , identify trends in financial and economic policy at an early stage and ensure that the dialogue between the financial institutions and the *UNK* is much more effective than it has been .
p1033
aVMr President , the measures we are discussing here this evening are to be welcomed .
p1034
aVI think they show that the European Union has the capacity , the will and the intelligence to take measures arising out of the lessons we have learned from the economic crisis .
p1035
aVAnd , particularly , I think that some have said that this is a transfer of powers from Member States to the European Union .
p1036
aVThis is the old *UNK* *UNK* that is brought forward to object to every proposal .
p1037
aVIf you are part of the European Union it has to have some powers , and certainly we are sending out a message to the markets and the citizens that we can deal with crucial issues when they occur .
p1038
aVCertainly , I agree completely with what we are doing and I also would *UNK* to see us adopting automatic , binding sanctions and also the reverse qualified majority voting system .
p1039
aVThat would ensure that we would stay out of crisis in the future .
p1040
aV*UNK* is better than *UNK* and this is all about prevention .
p1041
aV*UNK* from what we have learned already .
p1042
aV( FR ) Mr President , we need to establish economic governance in order to get the European Union out of this continuing crisis .
p1043
aVWe need to coordinate our policies ; we need to be transparent in how we manage our national budgets and , above all , we need to bring down our *UNK* .
p1044
aVHowever , do you really think you are on the right track ?
p1045
aVThe European *UNK* is getting ready simply to abolish the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy .
p1046
aVIt *UNK* to implement the financial *UNK* tax and *UNK* and its eyes are *UNK* on the *UNK* agencies , which did not see the *UNK* crisis coming , which shows just how reliable they are .
p1047
aVLet us be clear about this : we are in a crisis that was brought about by *UNK* and by the blind trust that governments and the EU placed in *UNK* markets .
p1048
aVAnd how do we intend to get out of it ?
p1049
aVThrough more *UNK* and *UNK* .
p1050
aVWe need growth ; we need to boost demand , and it is not by bringing our fellow citizens to their *UNK* that we will achieve this .
p1051
aVYou are on the wrong track .
p1052
aV( EL ) Mr President , as a Greek , I wish to thank all my fellow members who spoke positively about Greece and to stress that I think that the survival of a State *UNK* party political *UNK* and positions .
p1053
aVWe are talking about a Europe of the future .
p1054
aVWe have still not understood and we are still trying to understand the Europe of the past , to understand how we got where we are today .
p1055
aVI am sorry to say that some people have demonstrated *UNK* *UNK* , especially in Greece ; however , many others have demonstrated *UNK* *UNK* .
p1056
aVWe say that private investment is the solution to the problem .
p1057
aVThe private *UNK* have gone elsewhere .
p1058
aVWe tend to forget that .
p1059
aVThey have gone to other areas of the *UNK* .
p1060
aVThere is no competitiveness in Europe ; Europe is getting old ; it is no longer competitive and has nothing to offer .
p1061
aVWhat we ... *UNK* ( The President cut off the speaker ) ( *UNK* ) Mr President , I am grateful for the hard work of the rapporteurs , *UNK* , the Hungarian Presidency and everyone who made it possible for us to have the *UNK* ' of economic governance here in this form today .
p1062
aVIt would be good to think that this package is no longer necessary and Europe 's economic problems will be solved *UNK* .
p1063
aVUnfortunately , this is not the case .
p1064
aVEurope is not over the crisis yet , and if we do not act *UNK* , we will have to face further crises in the future .
p1065
aVI agree with those responsible *UNK* who say that we have to adopt a more stringent budget and have to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact .
p1066
aVWe have to say it out *UNK* that the European Union has been taking an *UNK* *UNK* approach so far , it did not have mechanisms to react to crisis situations , and was therefore unable to respond adequately to the serious consequences of the crisis which caused economic , financial and social *UNK* .
p1067
aVWe can not let this happen again , and at the same time we have to learn from the *UNK* of the past .
p1068
aV( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , rapporteur , good economic governance in Europe is necessary ; of course it is .
p1069
aVHowever , if we vote for these six texts , we will be leaving Member States no freedom to follow investment policies for *UNK* growth .
p1070
aVAt a time when citizens are increasingly losing faith in the EU , when Greece is on its *UNK* and the *UNK* agencies are *UNK* to States , Parliament should stop this *UNK* *UNK* on *UNK* at all costs .
p1071
aVThe Union now wants to respond to a crisis of the neoliberal model with neoliberal *UNK* and systematic expenditure cuts , especially in social security , even though this expenditure is known to be a defence against economic crises .
p1072
aVWithout adding the elements advocated by the progressive groups in this Parliament , I do not see how we can agree to vote in favour of these texts .
p1073
aVWe would actually be creating a split personality for ourselves , considering that we have adopted resolutions on the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy and that we are drafting reports , as I am doing myself , on implementing the *UNK* to combat poverty .
p1074
aVThe economic governance that is being proposed ... ( The President cut off the speaker ) ( NL ) Mr President , the *UNK* of the Stability and Growth Pact is urgently needed .
p1075
aVThe *UNK* of recent years make that clear .
p1076
aVI am also pleased that the outcome of the negotiations is a step in the right direction .
p1077
aVMinisters will never again be permitted to cover each other 's *UNK* when a Member State allows its public finances to *UNK* .
p1078
aVIt would therefore be a good thing if we were to improve the prevention of major *UNK* by moving decision-making further away from politics .
p1079
aV*UNK* *UNK* is therefore right to insist on the idea that ministers should be able to block decisions by qualified majority only .
p1080
aVHowever , a *UNK* point for me is Commissioner *UNK* 's statement , which is related to this legislative package .
p1081
aVThis is a step towards the introduction of *UNK* .
p1082
aVThe President of the ECB has indicated that it would be *UNK* to have *UNK* introduced in a situation where budgetary discipline is lacking .
p1083
aV*UNK* new *UNK* will *UNK* the European debt problem .
p1084
aVMoreover , the Group of the *UNK* Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance want to exempt public investment from the standard of a maximum ... ( The President cut off the speaker ) - ( SK ) Mr President , the package of measures on economic governance is a *UNK* response to the obvious problems of an economic and financial nature that have long *UNK* the European Union .
p1085
aVThe economic crisis has led many *UNK* countries into serious debt problems , and it is clear that the rules of the stability pact did not protect the currency union from the results of *UNK* and *UNK* management by the governments of some countries .
p1086
aVEven though I do not think the European Commission should have more powers than it had previously , I agree that the European currency union must establish a more precise mutual control mechanism for budgetary policy .
p1087
aVSome members of the currency union are paying for the *UNK* or *UNK* of others , and a move towards greater transparency and clearer budgetary rules leading to the *UNK* of long-term problems in our countries has therefore become essential .
p1088
aVIt will be important , however , for us also to apply the rules we adopt consistently , and not to produce all kinds of *UNK* from them ( The President cut off the *UNK* ) ( RO ) Mr President , a *UNK* , *UNK* strategy is required to ensure a high level of competitiveness , sustainable economic growth and job creation .
p1089
aVA strong , effective Stability and Growth Pact is the key instrument in this .
p1090
aVIndeed , additional efforts should be made to prevent *UNK* budgetary policies from being adopted .
p1091
aVThe enhanced economic governance framework will be *UNK* by different *UNK* policies .
p1092
aVThis package of proposals will help encourage Member States to apply a *UNK* budgetary policy and , if appropriate , to adopt *UNK* measures in good time to restrict penalties from being imposed .
p1093
aV*UNK* is easier than *UNK* .
p1094
aV( DE ) Mr President , the line being taken by the governments of the core Member States of the EU , the European Commission and the European Central Bank can be clearly identified .
p1095
aVNew rescue *UNK* are being put together for Greece , *UNK* of euros of taxpayers ' money is being put at risk and plans are being drawn up for economic governance for the whole of Europe , as we have just heard .
p1096
aVThe main aim of the Commission 's proposals is to *UNK* up the regulations of the Stability and Growth Pact .
p1097
aVIn future , compliance with the Maastricht criteria will be *UNK* by imposing much *UNK* penalties .
p1098
aVHowever , this pact has not worked in the past and I am *UNK* that it will not work in the future either .
p1099
aVAt the same time , one mechanism after another is being put in place to support the countries with budget *UNK* , once again involving taxpayers ' money .
p1100
aVWe are *UNK* the *UNK* rather than eliminating the causes .
p1101
aVThis highly *UNK* strategy will come back to *UNK* Europe in the short or the long term .
p1102
aVIt is *UNK* to expect the same *UNK* countries always to pay for the mistakes of others .
p1103
aVVice-President of the Commission .
p1104
aV- Mr President , I am not sure if I can respond to all of the Members .
p1105
aVWe would not have time for that , but I will try to provide some *UNK* as regards the points made this evening .
p1106
aVI want to , first of all , thank you all for a very substantial and *UNK* debate which reflects an overall sense of responsibility for Europe 's economic future , for growth and stability , and for our citizens ' welfare .
p1107
aVI believe we all broadly share the view that balanced and healthy public finances are a necessary condition for sustainable growth and improving employment , which is the goal of the current legislative package .
p1108
aVThat is why it deserves your support .
p1109
aVAs many of you have *UNK* , it is an essential building block in our comprehensive policy response to the current and still ongoing financial and sovereign crisis .
p1110
aVWhy is it so important to adopt this package at the current *UNK* ?
p1111
aVBecause we must be able to show our citizens , economic actors and the international partners that the European Union really can in future prevent a fiscal crisis such as the one we have recently experienced , in the case of Greece for instance .
p1112
aV*UNK* again .
p1113
aVThat is the first building block of this legislative package .
p1114
aVThat is why we need *UNK* budgetary surveillance and effective enforcement as proposed in the package and indeed by your rapporteurs and your committee .
p1115
aVThat is also why we need a genuinely and effectively functioning mechanism to identify and correct *UNK* imbalances , in order to prevent the kind of crises we have seen , for instance in Ireland or the credit *UNK* we have seen in Spain .
p1116
aVThat is why we need the second building block in this package : an effective mechanism to identify and address *UNK* imbalances .
p1117
aVSome of you , like *UNK* *UNK* , *UNK* *UNK* and *UNK* *UNK* , have asked whether we consider that the issue of *UNK* has been *UNK* .
p1118
aVI can provide you with my interpretation and the Commission 's interpretation of this issue which in fact , if you look at the texts , is extremely complicated .
p1119
aVI hope that nobody would block this package for the sake of that because it would be impossible simply to explain it to our citizens .
p1120
aVThe *UNK* of both the Council and Parliament cover both the deficit and *UNK* countries .
p1121
aVThat is very clear .
p1122
aVThe differences in drafting would have no *UNK* impact on the scope or emphasis concerning the economic surveillance to be carried out .
p1123
aVI hope that Parliament and the Council can work together and find an agreement that is based on the substance and not the *UNK* .
p1124
aVThere is practically no difference , so let us *UNK* the *UNK* and conclude this important issue of *UNK* so that we can start working in order to identify and also correct the *UNK* imbalances and competitiveness *UNK* .
p1125
aVSo , all in all , your vote tomorrow will be a very important one , a very crucial one for the European Union and its capacity to convince our general public , economic actors and international partners of our capacity to overcome the crisis and facilitate sustainable growth .
p1126
aVTherefore your vote tomorrow will be a great opportunity to achieve a historic *UNK* of *UNK* the monetary union finally with a true and genuinely functioning economic union - which we definitely need - and thus enabling the European Union to come out of the current serious crisis with lessons learnt , *UNK* also stronger for the future and , in any case , with new appropriate policy tools for sustainable growth , employment and for our citizens ' benefit .
p1127
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1128
aV- Mr President , I am glad most of the contributions indicate that the job which was *UNK* to us - and by *UNK* ' I mean Parliament and the Council - to agree on a very ambitious and new economic governance package , is *UNK* % completed .
p1129
aVI am also in agreement with many of the honourable Members that , after the hard work of negotiations , we have to get the deal done .
p1130
aVI am *UNK* because , here in this House , I feel a commitment and a real sense of ownership towards the future of Europe .
p1131
aVLet me make a few comments on the particular issue - which is still open *UNK* the extension of reverse qualified majority voting .
p1132
aVDuring the last six or seven weeks , the Council has discussed Parliament 's proposals at least on a *UNK* basis .
p1133
aVIn the last four weeks the *UNK* Ministers of the 27 Member States discussed the package three times , and each time they made major concessions to Parliament on various points of the text in order to *UNK* the way for a *UNK* agreement .
p1134
aVWe discussed all aspects of all the proposals at various levels .
p1135
aV*UNK* , you proposed that the reverse qualified majority voting rule be applied in more than 15 *UNK* .
p1136
aVIn some cases it was not legally feasible to do so , and we identified where that was the case very quickly .
p1137
aVSome of the other points in question were already included in the Council 's general approach to the decision on imposing financial sanctions .
p1138
aVIn May , the Council agreed to reverse qualified majority voting in two places in addition to the general approach .
p1139
aVOn Monday the Council made large concessions , in the last case on the *UNK* arm of the Pact , including a review clause in three years ' time and the *UNK* or explain ' procedure , which was strengthened in comparison with the previous agreement in the March *UNK* Council .
p1140
aVThese safeguards can give Parliament the necessary *UNK* that *UNK* from the Commission 's proposals and recommendations will be kept to a minimum and that cases of *UNK* with the rules , and thus the need for explanations , will be very *UNK* exceptions .
p1141
aVIt is definitely time for Parliament to reconsider its initial position and to make a move towards the Council .
p1142
aVThe markets and *UNK* are vigilant , and they would like to see whether we can deliver the agreement in the coming days or not .
p1143
aVI believe it is essential for us to do so .
p1144
aVIn addition , this package could demonstrate how European institutions can cooperate in a responsible , efficient and constructive manner in such an important field .
p1145
aVSeveral times during the *UNK* , I heard serious criticisms from Members of Parliament about intergovernmental procedures .
p1146
aVThe swift and *UNK* adoption of the package could prove that the Community method is the right approach to use in going forward .
p1147
aVMr President , I am grateful for everyone 's contributions to this debate , and particularly the *UNK* given by Commissioner *UNK* and the President-in-Office of the Council , *UNK* *UNK* .
p1148
aVI would just like to stress one point : concessions have in fact been made on both sides , and I think we are very close to agreement , but I would not like them to fail to note the question of *UNK* and *UNK* as an important issue that needs addressing .
p1149
aVThat and reverse qualified majority voting are points on which adjustments are still being made , and there is no conclusion on them yet .
p1150
aVI am particularly grateful for Commissioner *UNK* 's positive contribution but , if there is to be an agreement , it will have to be based on the legal text - on the articles section - including of course Article 32 , Article 42 and *UNK* *UNK* , as has been *UNK* debated .
p1151
aVI would therefore be grateful if you would bear this issue in mind , because it is one that cuts across the interests of several Members of this House and several political groups , as you have seen .
p1152
aVHaving said that , I think the new factor of the analysis of *UNK* imbalances can be useful .
p1153
aVI apologise , Commissioner , not only for *UNK* problems of *UNK* in the property or financial markets , but also for *UNK* out the importance of Europe 's major problem : the *UNK* generated by the completely *UNK* ways in which the economies that make up the euro area *UNK* .
p1154
aV*UNK* now these *UNK* are seriously threatening the existence of a common currency with a *UNK* monetary area , as was very well highlighted today by Mr *UNK* y *UNK* .
p1155
aVThe fact is that the European Union is *UNK* and *UNK* .
p1156
aVWhat we are doing is not enough to make up for the *UNK* that the European economy has at the moment , and I think that the *UNK* of *UNK* everything on the mistakes of the *UNK* , the *UNK* and the wrong - compared with the *UNK* who have no problems - is an extremely dangerous *UNK* that we must all avoid .
p1157
aVAfter all , the history of Europe proves that simple explanations for complex problems never give good results .
p1158
aVThat , then , is the appeal that I am making here .
p1159
aVMr President , I am grateful for all the contributions that have been made to this debate , and I would like to express my very special thanks - because I did not do so just now - for the crucial role played in all this by Mrs *UNK* , the Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
p1160
aVI want to point out that this economic governance package brings greater transparency for the institutions and a better and larger role for Parliament .
p1161
aVThe package also forms part of the euro 's *UNK* .
p1162
aVAnyone who believes that the very best solutions for growth are not here must also admit that they do not know of any country that fails to grow if its public accounts are in order .
p1163
aV*UNK* that show budgetary discipline are countries with economies that grow , and we must not forget that .
p1164
aVThat is the example that we must set here .
p1165
aVThat is the example that is being followed right now , for instance , in my country .
p1166
aVI also want to put a question to all the Members of this Parliament : can you say that this economic governance package is worse today than when it *UNK* here ?
p1167
aVCan you say that no improvements have been made to it by this House ?
p1168
aVYou can not say that , because it is not true .
p1169
aVThis economic governance package today is better than the Commission 's initial proposal , and it is better because of the many contributions made by the Members of this House .
p1170
aVThat is why we have to give our citizens a very clear answer .
p1171
aVWe want a growing European economy .
p1172
aVWe want stability .
p1173
aVWe certainly want transparency .
p1174
aVTo achieve all that , however , we must show a sense of responsibility at voting time tomorrow ; we must necessarily vote *UNK* and choose our partners very well .
p1175
aVFor my part , my choice is very clear : I will be voting for a better Europe and a better European economy .
p1176
aVMadam President , my thanks to everyone for this debate , to the Commissioner and to the Minister , Mr *UNK* .
p1177
aVFirst of all , I wanted to say to the Minister that I think we have already proved that the Community method works well .
p1178
aVAs *UNK* *UNK* just said , I think the text has actually been improved , and I think that when there is public debate we are doing our job and citizens can be informed about what is going on in Brussels , as they say .
p1179
aVWhy is it , therefore , that we are still talking about the *UNK* qualified majority ?
p1180
aVI want to make a simple point .
p1181
aVIn this Parliament , there are countries for example with a larger population , who have more Members .
p1182
aVWhen it comes to the votes , each country has a vote that *UNK* its size .
p1183
aVHowever , what democracy has a system whereby when it comes to applying the rule , we treat the people covered by the rule differently ?
p1184
aVWhen it comes to putting into practice rules that we have agreed on together , we can not start making exceptions .
p1185
aVCitizens expect the law to be applied equally to everyone .
p1186
aVAt the European level also , all Member States , whether big or small , should be in the same *UNK* .
p1187
aVThis is why we are fighting : it is not an ideological battle , it is a matter of the general interest .
p1188
aVMy second point is about *UNK* , and I am addressing Mrs *UNK* in particular .
p1189
aVThis is an important issue : it is part of the agreement .
p1190
aVWe must be aware that it has been very expensive for some of us , and to ensure we see it through until the end , we need as wide a unity as possible in this Parliament on all the aspects of the deal .
p1191
aVWe need to be united .
p1192
aVAs the Commissioner said , I think there are no differences between us so great that we can not overcome them .
p1193
aVI am *UNK* for unity , therefore .
p1194
aVWe can not ask for support and at the same time leave others in *UNK* .
p1195
aVAs for my last point , I wanted to thank Mr *UNK* very specifically on the small point of *UNK* or explain ' .
p1196
aVI have asked you so many times during our discussions : what does that mean , *UNK* or explain ' , and explain to whom ?
p1197
aVYou have been a good *UNK* ; you have moved the Council along .
p1198
aVThey are ready to do it in public .
p1199
aVThey are planning ahead for economic dialogue .
p1200
aVThank you .
p1201
aV*UNK* them to go a bit further still : this is all we ask .
p1202
aVYou have done so very successfully , so I am sure we will get there .
p1203
aVrapporteur .
p1204
aV- ( NL ) Madam President , I , too , would also like to thank everybody who has participated in the debate and everybody who has supported us with such clear arguments .
p1205
aVI would also like to thank *UNK* *UNK* , Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , because the situation was very complicated and it will certainly be thanks to her if we get a positive outcome to the vote tomorrow .
p1206
aVWe have had quite an ideological debate today and it is clear that everyone in this House would like to have sustainable public finances and budgetary discipline , but history shows that you can not achieve that by just spending more money .
p1207
aVWe now have a package before us .
p1208
aVWe have achieved a great deal .
p1209
aVCommissioner *UNK* has 15 points on his list and it could be that there are some Members who have problems with the detail in this package , but if you look at the alternative offered by the Left , it leaves us even worse off .
p1210
aVI therefore hope that , tomorrow , Members will be prepared to rise to the challenge of this very important legislative package for this Parliament , which for the first time in its history is exercising *UNK* powers , just as the Council does .
p1211
aVWe will have to clear a few more *UNK* next week , but *UNK* we will have a positive outcome to the vote tomorrow .
p1212
aVWe therefore have one more week to go and I hope that we will ultimately be able to take a decision on first reading in July , because we are *UNK* % there .
p1213
aVOn behalf of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) , I would also like to emphasise what Mrs *UNK* said about *UNK* and *UNK* .
p1214
aVThere is indeed a give and take in this House and everyone has their priorities .
p1215
aVHowever , that principle of give and take should also be applied , in terms of *UNK* , to this Parliament eventually adopting a position on this package .
p1216
aV- The debate is closed .
p1217
aVThe vote will take place on Thursday 23 June 2011 .
p1218
aVWritten statements ( Rule *UNK* ) At a time when the impact of the recession and public debt crisis is being strongly felt , we need robust economic governance at EU level .
p1219
aVHowever , the economic governance legislative package would not , in its present form , help the European Union 's economy to *UNK* , but would bring about a situation where high unemployment and poverty would be permanent *UNK* .
p1220
aVI think that the proposals in this package are not ambitious enough , as they are only *UNK* towards *UNK* and *UNK* citizens ' social rights .
p1221
aVThere is no mention of elements which could *UNK* a European economic recovery , such as making investments in the key areas of infrastructure , education , research and innovation .
p1222
aVWe are able to propose an alternative to this *UNK* model which , as we can see from Greece , is proving to be extremely limited .
p1223
aVThe creation of *UNK* to be issued jointly for part of Europe 's public debt would automatically reduce the cost of financing in the European Union and would allow the *UNK* of investment .
p1224
aVFollowing the New *UNK* policy model from the United States , the solution to the current economic and financial crisis will involve *UNK* economic growth based on investments and creating new jobs .
p1225
aVIt is important that the EU does not just respond to the crisis by eliminating the most *UNK* problems , but that it also *UNK* more fundamental reform of economic governance .
p1226
aVMany points in the submitted reports go in the right direction , but at the same time they have a number of deficiencies .
p1227
aVThe proposals talk about *UNK* sanctions , about *UNK* for the *UNK* of recommendations and about these being applied automatically , in order to avoid *UNK* to political *UNK* .
p1228
aVThis is all very well .
p1229
aVI can not rid myself of the feeling that the sanctions are *UNK* to those states that are currently in a difficult situation .
p1230
aVThey seem to be based on the idea that these states can deal with the difficult situation themselves , and that they are capable of improving their situation by themselves through a *UNK* ' approach .
p1231
aVThat is a mistake , however .
p1232
aVEven before the crisis , a dynamic developed in Europe whereby the strong states of the *UNK* *UNK* their competitive advantage .
p1233
aVThanks , among other things , to wage dumping in Germany , for example , the core countries strengthened their export position , and the peripheral countries became *UNK* *UNK* for their products and capital .
p1234
aVFor these countries , the crisis was the last *UNK* in the *UNK* .
p1235
aVIt is not possible to escape from this situation by *UNK* alone , or through one 's own decisions .
p1236
aVThe situation regarding *UNK* imbalances , particularly in countries with the single currency , can be resolved only through a *UNK* *UNK* of the current model of economic development .
p1237
aVIt is not just cuts and budgetary discipline that will bring a solution , but a policy of targeted development and support for the competitiveness of Europe 's *UNK* .
p1238
aVAs usual , on the pretext of *UNK* out problems that you have caused *UNK* , you are imposing on us more Europe and more Commission power : this Commission that is little more than a *UNK* of civil *UNK* appointed with no democratic *UNK* , but that has been set up as a *UNK* and *UNK* that will have the right to impose sanctions on Member States .
p1239
aVYour *UNK* economic governance goes far beyond budgetary *UNK* .
p1240
aVIt is nothing short of imposing *UNK* on our peoples and nations .
p1241
aVThis is an application of the *UNK* of limited sovereignty that was so close to the heart of that great *UNK* *UNK* , except instead of *UNK* we have financial penalties .
p1242
aVI am not *UNK* : one of these reports feels it necessary to state that in the event of a change in majority after an election , the new government must obtain authorisation before *UNK* its *UNK* 's budget priorities , and even then can only do so around the *UNK* .
p1243
aVAs for the priorities themselves , they are those imposed by the European Union : *UNK* private *UNK* , *UNK* the markets , dismantling social security and *UNK* liberalisation at every turn , in keeping with the EU 2020 strategy .
p1244
aVThis is not *UNK* mistakes , improving public management or preventing another Greek situation : this is democracy held at *UNK* .
p1245
aVThe crisis may provide us with an opportunity to change our rules and institutions , or to create new ones .
p1246
aVThe *UNK* *UNK* *UNK* talked about *UNK* destruction ' .
p1247
aVAt present , the EU therefore has a unique opportunity to establish a new mechanism that should lead to greater *UNK* , fiscal and currency stability for the Member States in the long term , and help increase their competitiveness .
p1248
aVThe experience we have gained from the past operation of the Economic and Monetary Union has shown that such rules need to be enshrined in legislation , and that we can not rely on the good will of individual Member States .
p1249
aVFor this reason , the submitted legislative package containing six proposals for establishing an improved framework for economic management is a step in the right direction .
p1250
aV*UNK* proposals relate to fiscal matters , including a reform of the Stability and Growth Pact , while the two new regulations try to identify and resolve *UNK* imbalances emerging within the EU and the euro area .
p1251
aVIn order to enforce these new rules effectively , however , it is and it will continue to be *UNK* for both the national parliaments and the European Parliament to be involved in the whole process more closely and at an earlier point in time .
p1252
aVOverall , I believe that the legislative package which has been presented is an appropriate response to the global crisis and the EU 's current economic situation , building on the relevant legislation and *UNK* with the Europe 2020 strategy and other strategic EU documents , and therefore I recommend adopting it in the amended version .
p1253
aVin writing .
p1254
aV- ( *UNK* ) The lack of suitable instruments for *UNK* public finance problems early , along with the *UNK* operating mechanisms of the Stability and Growth Pact , are among the basic causes of the *UNK* crisis which the euro area and EU are going through .
p1255
aVThis legislative package allows us to take appropriate measures to rectify the imbalances before they have an adverse impact on public finances .
p1256
aVThey will allow the European Commission to monitor , on an ongoing basis , the *UNK* development of Member States and , if necessary , an in-depth analysis of national economies will be carried out .
p1257
aVThis is why the indicators for monitoring *UNK* development and their *UNK* must not be adopted automatically by the Commission , but must be analysed from an economic perspective .
p1258
aVWhen the *UNK* is being produced , it is important that the different initial positions of the Member States are taken into consideration , along with their *UNK* features , which *UNK* for the countries in the euro area and the remaining countries in the EU .
p1259
aVWhen analysing the indicators ' *UNK* , consideration must be given to the *UNK* process which new Member States are involved in .
p1260
aVThis is the only possible way of ensuring that an appropriate analysis of their *UNK* development is carried out .
p1261
aVin writing .
p1262
aV- The economic integration of the European Union and in particular the euro has reached a *UNK* at which one can no longer turn a blind eye to *UNK* *UNK* from the criteria that have been set in order to safeguard economic stability in the Union .
p1263
aVTherefore , I would call for *UNK* the role of the Commission with regard to the economic governance of the EU .
p1264
aV*UNK* , automatic mechanisms ought to be established and executed when certain Member States consistently breach the Stability and Growth Pact .
p1265
aVThe economic crisis has exposed the *UNK* financial and economic decisions of several governments , but it is the *UNK* Member States that are paying the price .
p1266
aVThe crisis has *UNK* us a painful , but all the more valuable lesson for the future .
p1267
aVThe Commission ought to be *UNK* to intervene without prejudice whenever it receives alarming signals from any Member State and the Council should not back the *UNK* .
p1268
aV*UNK* talked about solidarity will not be *UNK* and , unless we call the *UNK* to order , the citizens of countries such as Estonia might lose their *UNK* .
p1269
aV*UNK* of the economic governance package proves yet again that the European project is still *UNK* and that it is on the basis of conciliation among the 27 that the Member States will overcome their difficulties and , at the same time , confront the challenges of the future .
p1270
aVThe sovereign public debt crisis shows that the current *UNK* and *UNK* mechanisms are inadequate .
p1271
aVThe measures put to the vote today seek to strengthen the instruments that are not working , and therefore it is essential that they are put into practice .
p1272
aVThe debt criterion , as approved in the Treaty of Maastricht , is at last made operational in this new package and will now actually be applied .
p1273
aVThe *UNK* of the European *UNK* , the *UNK* of the dialogue between the European institutions and national bodies , the role of Parliament and the Commission throughout the monitoring process , as well as greater and more effective supervision are all ways of achieving intelligent , sustainable and inclusive growth in Europe .
p1274
aVHowever , I must stress that the success of Europe 's economic policy must also depend on other , *UNK* measures to support investment and growth in the Member States .
p1275
aVEurope must focus on a common strategy , but it must not forget the specific features of each country .
p1276
aVAs the past year has shown , the so-called Stability and Growth Pact , which was intended to provide an effective *UNK* against violations of the *UNK* principles of the euro area by the Member States , has not been *UNK* effective , to put it *UNK* .
p1277
aVThis is due to a large extent to the fact that the Member States *UNK* they could act with *UNK* , since the sanctions provided for by the system were not automatic .
p1278
aVWe are in agreement as to the form of sanctions which would be imposed on countries in the euro area which exceeded the permitted level of deficit and public debt .
p1279
aVHowever , it is equally important to take *UNK* measures , and therefore we in the European Parliament are in favour of introducing an automatic mechanism in the *UNK* arm of the Pact as well .
p1280
aVThe entire process also requires greater transparency , and this can only be ensured by greater involvement of the European Parliament and the national parliaments .
p1281
aVIn March and June 2010 , the European Council adopted the Europe 2020 strategy , the main priority of which is enhanced coordination of economic policy strategies in the Member States and , as a long-term goal , sustainable and inclusive growth and sustainable employment .
p1282
aVSince economic governance regards public debt as equivalent to a deficit , we should make every effort to ensure that the *UNK* budgetary framework which is put in place helps to reduce the burden on future generations .
p1283
aVIn doing so , we must use the experience gained during the first *UNK* of functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union .
p1284
aV*UNK* *UNK* to the rules and procedures that form the budgetary framework urgently need to be *UNK* , in order to ensure similar social protection benefits and to fight social exclusion .
p1285
aVIn view of the high level of *UNK* between the budgets of the Member States and the EU budget , budgetary forecasts at both levels should be characterised by the same degree of transparency .
p1286
aVThis is why it is so important for an agreement to be in place between the Commission and each Member State as regards the scope of forecasts and *UNK* methods .
p1287
aVCooperation of this kind would make it possible to avoid contradictory *UNK* *UNK* and to increase the credibility of forecasts using for planning .
p1288
aVThe economic crisis and its repercussions have shown us that the EU 's future needs to be built on European rather than domestic solutions .
p1289
aV*UNK* up with a viable solution to the sovereign debt crisis and the need to strengthen the euro , return to a path of sustainable growth and create new jobs depend on efficient coordination between Member States and strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact .
p1290
aVIn a *UNK* , this depends on a strong Europe , a goal also expressed in the *UNK* of the European Council 's Hungarian Presidency .
p1291
aVThe European economic governance package on the European Parliament 's agenda can create the mechanisms the EU needs for its future , in the way that its *UNK* *UNK* it .
p1292
aV*UNK* the economic governance package will *UNK* close coordination , fiscal discipline , economic supervision , effective decision-making rules , powerful European institutions , thereby *UNK* the EU 's *UNK* .
p1293
aVThe economic crisis has changed the world *UNK* and there is clearly an increasingly urgent need for a new financial structure in the EU .
p1294
aVWe are at a turning point .
p1295
aVAny weakening of Member States ' ambition to complete the reforms which have been initiated under the *UNK* of the crisis , excessive *UNK* , too many exceptions to the *UNK* accepted rules and a return to a new round of internal protectionism will deal *UNK* *UNK* .
p1296
aVin writing .
p1297
aV- ( SK ) I do not believe that governments or officials can manage the economy .
p1298
aVAt the same time , I understand that we must seek the causes of the financial problems of Greece and other EU states , and find a way to *UNK* these in the future .
p1299
aVDemocracy *UNK* *UNK* in the balance , as we restrict the right of citizens to decide on the budget of their own state , and thus the priorities of state policy .
p1300
aV*UNK* is possible , however , only if responsible governance is the rule for all .
p1301
aVWe are thus approaching a *UNK* .
p1302
aVOne road leads to a *UNK* in European integration , and possibly a *UNK* .
p1303
aVThe other road leads to tax harmonisation , the end of national budgets and a federal *UNK* .
p1304
aVIn a case such as that , however , we are also talking about a *UNK* system of health insurance contributions , social insurance and pensions throughout the EU .
p1305
aVIt is these arguments , and not the *UNK* *UNK* about unity , that make up the debate on a federal Europe .
p1306
aVCouncil *UNK* *UNK* The next item is *UNK* *UNK* ( *UNK* ) .
p1307
aVWe will be taking the following questions to the Council .
p1308
aVSubject : *UNK* of services and freedom of movement for families with children European families are protesting in increasing numbers against the discrimination to which they are subjected in connection with the provision of services and exercising their right to freedom of movement within the EU because they are accompanied by children under the age of 15 .
p1309
aV*UNK* articles in the Greek press have taken a positive view of the exclusion of children from commercial public *UNK* such as *UNK* , *UNK* , etc .
p1310
aVWhat measures will the Council take to eliminate discrimination and age *UNK* ' against children , *UNK* and their families ?
p1311
aVAre there plans to harmonise the requirements in regard to the provision of services and guaranteeing freedom of movement within the EU to prevent the *UNK* of the rights of young Europeans and their families ?
p1312
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1313
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , in reply to the question the Council would first like to remind everyone that Article 18 ( 1 ) of the Treaty establishing the European Community states : *UNK* citizen of the Union shall have the right to move and *UNK* freely within the territory of the Member States , subject to the *UNK* and conditions laid down in this Treaty and by the measures adopted to give it effect ' .
p1314
aVAs the honourable Member certainly knows , the Commission , as the body that *UNK* the Treaty , must ensure that the provisions of the Treaty and the rules and regulations made by the institutions pursuant to it are complied with .
p1315
aVThat being the case , the question by the honourable Member should really be put to the Commission .
p1316
aVIn July this year the Commission published a communication aiming at an EU strategy on children 's rights with the purpose of promoting and protecting children 's rights effectively in internal and external policies of the European Union and supporting measures taken in this area by the Member States .
p1317
aV*UNK* on child and family policy proper are taken at national level .
p1318
aV( EL ) Madam President , I too wish to take my turn in *UNK* the Council representative that the Commission may design the strategy , but the application of it is undertaken by the Member States .
p1319
aVIn the Council , all the Member States must establish what the situation is and what the problems are of families moving with children ; that is why I put this question to the Council , in knowledge of the Treaties and the new Commission communication .
p1320
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1321
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , we all have laws to prevent discrimination against all population groups and *UNK* , such as the *UNK* *UNK* Directive and the Directive on discrimination in employment and occupation .
p1322
aVThey incorporate rules on such areas as the *UNK* of discrimination in many everyday situations .
p1323
aVAs for the examples given of , for example , *UNK* culture by the honourable Member , we do have to remember that citizens of the Member States , in addition to the Council , have , as consumers and , when it comes down to it , those who are paying for these services , also have considerable powers of influence on what sort of culture should *UNK* from the perspective of families with children .
p1324
aV( DE ) Madam President , I just wanted to draw your attention to the fact that this is a problem not only in Greece , but also in Austria , where it is positively *UNK* , and where *UNK* count it as one of their main *UNK* points that they allow no children , or will not *UNK* families with them .
p1325
aVWhat I would like to know is whether something can be done about this , at any rate as regards advertising .
p1326
aVThere are , after all , other areas in which advertising can be restricted , and that might be one possibility .
p1327
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1328
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , there has of course been much discussion in the area of advertising relating to children , especially with regard to marketing and what sort of marketing and in what situation it is suitable when it is aimed at children .
p1329
aVAs concerns the example given by the honourable Member asking the additional question with regard to *UNK* , I would say again what I said in my previous answer , that obviously consumer organisations and paying customers can have a say in what sort of services should be on offer .
p1330
aVSubject : *UNK* of *UNK* Frontex , the body responsible for monitoring the Union 's external borders that was set up last year , has *UNK* its operations , but is *UNK* and *UNK* *UNK* .
p1331
aVWill the Council propose the adoption of measures to increase the effectiveness of Frontex , whether by cooperation between Member States or by allocating additional resources at Community level ?
p1332
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1333
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , it is Council Regulation of 26 October 2004 establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union that provides for the establishment of Frontex and its tasks , structure and the requirements *UNK* to its financial administration .
p1334
aVUnder the Regulation , the Council is given information concerning the Agency 's action programme , the general and special risk *UNK* that it *UNK* , an annual general report and the Agency 's budget .
p1335
aV*UNK* to amend the Regulation 's provisions may only be proposed by the Commission .
p1336
aVIt is primarily the task of Frontex 's Management Board to approve measures relating to its organisational structure , *UNK* policy and action programme , and the Council takes no part in it .
p1337
aVIt is still the responsibility of the institutions of the EU to *UNK* Community policy on the control of external borders and relevant legislation .
p1338
aV*UNK* coordination between the agency and the institutions must therefore be assured , and there are arrangements in existence for this purpose under the Frontex Regulation .
p1339
aVRegarding this , I would refer you to the relevant *UNK* for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a mechanism for the creation of *UNK* *UNK* *UNK* *UNK* .
p1340
aVIts purpose is to enhance *UNK* activities undertaken by the Agency and promote solidarity between Member States and the Community during a crisis .
p1341
aVThe European Council proposed last December that the Member States , the Council and the Commission should take certain measures before the end of the year to improve practical cooperation among the Member States .
p1342
aVThese included strengthened control and monitoring of the EU 's southern maritime border and the *UNK* study on the Mediterranean Coastal *UNK* Network , which Frontex has now completed .
p1343
aVIn recent months the Council , for example in its session on 24 July and at the informal ministerial meeting in September , has been paying particular attention to improving *UNK* cooperation between the Member States and Frontex , and , in particular , the situation in the Mediterranean region and Africa .
p1344
aVOn these occasions such themes as Frontex 's role and its participation in *UNK* activities , especially in the Mediterranean and with regard to the African situation , were discussed .
p1345
aVThe Council was satisfied with the measures implemented by Frontex and the Commission and stressed that *UNK* cooperation should continue to be developed further .
p1346
aVAt the end of October the Council also adopted its conclusions on strengthening the external maritime border in the *UNK* .
p1347
aVIn its conclusions it *UNK* Frontex to promote a feasibility study on the establishment of a European *UNK* System which , in its initial phase , would cover the whole of the southern maritime border of the Community and the Mediterranean Sea .
p1348
aVThe Council also asked Frontex to consider setting up regional centres with links to one another , which would be at Frontex 's disposal in operational matters in different maritime areas or sections *UNK* .
p1349
aVThe Council , however , does not have to propose that appropriations should be granted for Frontex 's budget for additional action .
p1350
aVAccording to Article *UNK* of Council Regulation establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union and the Hague Programme , the work of Frontex will be assessed with reference to a Commission evaluation before the end of next year .
p1351
aV( ES ) Madam President , the Council 's reply has *UNK* me , and I am going to say something surprising : Frontex has worked .
p1352
aVDespite being at an *UNK* stage , its work in the *UNK* *UNK* , in the large area of sea surrounding the *UNK* *UNK* , has been effective .
p1353
aVThe concern is the *UNK* of the institutions and the lack of economic and financial resources .
p1354
aVThe Presidency has referred to that , but the specific question I would like to ask is whether you believe that it will be possible to continue the Frontex operation in the Atlantic after 1 January , and whether the Council believes it is worth spending money on resources , on maintaining this Agency , which , I would repeat , has worked , is still working , and is proving to be effective .
p1355
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1356
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , first it is obviously encouraging to hear that Frontex has been successful .
p1357
aVWhile we admit that it has also had some problems , or at least challenges , we have to remember that the Agency is still very young and , at the same time , it has its administrative structure and tasks to attend to .
p1358
aVMoreover , it has already been involved in very many operations both in the Mediterranean Sea and elsewhere .
p1359
aVObviously , whether the scope and effectiveness of this operation can continue also depends on additional financing .
p1360
aV( DE ) Madam President , the President-in-Office of the Council spoke about how difficult it is to get funding for Frontex .
p1361
aVFrontex is being supported .
p1362
aVIs the Council also considering doing something to *UNK* the burden , for example *UNK* information campaigns in the countries of origin , in order to make potential migrants aware of the possible consequences of illegal immigration or of the other options available for legal immigration ?
p1363
aVIs it also considering reducing the *UNK* by taking action that would make it impossible , in future , to *UNK* illegal immigrants in the way in which they have been ?
p1364
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1365
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , one very crucial question , which relates generally to illegal immigration or immigration as a whole , is obviously the extent to which we cooperate with countries of origin and transit .
p1366
aV*UNK* in the Union the aim has been to focus special attention on points of contact between immigration itself and development , working on the notion that we should be able to enhance cooperation with countries of *UNK* so that the pressures on people *UNK* are also *UNK* in those places .
p1367
aVOf course , one area of this cooperation with countries of origin is to provide information on what is actually possible and what is not .
p1368
aVIn November the next high level conference between the EU and African countries will be held in *UNK* and the main theme there will be immigration .
p1369
aVI have two points .
p1370
aVFirst of all , a few months ago we were hearing about problems around the *UNK* of the agency in Poland : inadequate provision of *UNK* and so on .
p1371
aV*UNK* those problems been resolved ?
p1372
aVSecondly , will the *UNK* Presidency *UNK* to support and to *UNK* other Member States to accept the amendments that the European Parliament is about to vote to the budget of *UNK* ?
p1373
aVThis is Amendment *UNK* , to restore the sum as proposed by the Commission , *UNK* , not to follow the Council cuts and to put even more resources in *UNK* .
p1374
aVWill the *UNK* Presidency support that increase in resources ?
p1375
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1376
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , Frontex 's ability to deal with these illegal immigration situations , and that of the Union generally , naturally depends very much on what level of commitment there is in the Member States .
p1377
aVThis has been discussed recently in detail at various Union levels , most recently at the EU *UNK* Summit last Friday , but this debate is still going on , so in that respect it is still hard to give an absolutely precise answer to this question .
p1378
aVSubject : *UNK* information on *UNK* *UNK* What is the state of play in the Council regarding the proposed *UNK* Decision on the recognition and enforcement in the EU of *UNK* arising from *UNK* for sexual offences committed against children ' ?
p1379
aVIt would mean that if a *UNK* or child *UNK* was *UNK* from working with children after conviction for a sex attack or involvement in child *UNK* in one Member State , that information would be shared so that their name could be entered on other national sex *UNK* *UNK* and the ban *UNK* *UNK* .
p1380
aVWhy has the Council apparently been unable so far to agree on this important proposal which the European Parliament *UNK* in June 2006 and which would give a practical example to Europe 's citizens of the EU 's valuable role in combating crime and increasing security ?
p1381
aV*UNK* the Council abandoned its declared goal of prioritising the fight against the sexual exploitation of children ?
p1382
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1383
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium with a view to the adoption by the Council of a Framework Decision on the recognition and enforcement in the European Union of *UNK* arising from *UNK* for sexual offences committed against children of November 2004 is at present being debated by working groups in the Council .
p1384
aVMost recently it was discussed by the criminal case cooperation team in October , just a week ago .
p1385
aVAn examination of the initiative also forms part of the discussions which the Council working groups are holding on other proposals , such as that for a Framework Decision on taking account of *UNK* in the Member States of the European Union in the course of new criminal proceedings and that for a Council Framework Decision on the organisation and content of the exchange of information *UNK* from criminal *UNK* between Member States .
p1386
aVThere are thus two other proposals for framework decisions on the table .
p1387
aVThe aim which these instruments have in common is to create structures to ensure that details on someone 's criminal background are available generally and *UNK* .
p1388
aVWhen all the Member States have eventually implemented these acts in their national legislation , it should be easier to prevent a *UNK* individual from working with children or *UNK* crimes against children once again .
p1389
aVThe Council is therefore continuing to debate these proposals for framework decisions .
p1390
aVIt seems to me that the Council is going *UNK* fast on these proposals .
p1391
aV*UNK* two years ago we had an ambitious programme from the Commission in response to strong public interest in ensuring that criminals , like sex *UNK* , are not the ones who exploit borders and profit from them .
p1392
aVIt seems to me that Member States are not getting their act together on this .
p1393
aVI do not understand how we can tell our public that the EU is effective in combating crime if the Council is so slow in *UNK* on these *UNK* measures to make sure that criminals are truly *UNK* , wherever they go .
p1394
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1395
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , the protection of children , especially from the possibility of new *UNK* by those *UNK* of sex crimes , is obviously *UNK* important .
p1396
aVThere are , however , many very practical problems , as well as problems relating to principles , attached to these proposals for framework decisions , for example , the fact that this ban on occupation principle does not even exist in all the Member States .
p1397
aVWe therefore need to look for a way of dealing with the problem which can be applied in all the Member States of the Union .
p1398
aV( PT ) Madam President-in-Office of the Council , thank you very much for the information .
p1399
aVMy question is very precise and direct , so that we can *UNK* your position .
p1400
aVDoes the Council , that is to say , the *UNK* Presidency , not believe that citizens having access to personal data on those *UNK* of *UNK* or sexual violence against young people is an excellent tool in the fight against crime of this nature ?
p1401
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1402
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , this is an aim we all share : children can be protected from *UNK* individuals and there are different ways of doing that in the Member States .
p1403
aVFor example , in my country there is a system in place where an *UNK* has the right to obtain the criminal *UNK* of those seeking or applying for certain kinds of job and to use them to consider whether the person is suitable for the job .
p1404
aVSuch jobs , however , are very precisely defined .
p1405
aVThere are different ways of doing this in the Member States , and that is one reason why progress in this matter has been slow in the opinion of many Members of Parliament .
p1406
aVI should like to refer to a specific case as a means of *UNK* that the sharing of information is not enough .
p1407
aV*UNK* *UNK* *UNK* is a *UNK* *UNK* who served the *UNK* part of his sentence in my constituency of Northern Ireland and then recently took *UNK* in the Republic of Ireland , in breach of the *UNK* part of his sentence .
p1408
aVHe can now live there freely , and is unable to be arrested , whereas in Northern Ireland the penalty for *UNK* his *UNK* order would be an immediate return to prison .
p1409
aVIs this case not a clear indication that full *UNK* arrangements are needed , otherwise justice will be *UNK* and full protection not *UNK* to the vulnerable ?
p1410
aVCan the President-in-Office accept that proper *UNK* is the optimum requirement ?
p1411
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1412
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , this *UNK* *UNK* slot is obviously not about what I can personally endorse , but what sort of discussions and decisions the Council should *UNK* to .
p1413
aVThe Council , however , now intends to proceed in accordance with the *UNK* principle , which means that a Member State would be obliged to attach to *UNK* in a foreign court legal effects that are equivalent to those which they attach to national *UNK* , although this is ultimately very much to do with wider cooperation on justice and home affairs and how we can otherwise make progress in the area of mutual recognition of *UNK* and *UNK* and the matter of *UNK* .
p1414
aVSince its author is not present , *UNK* No 4 *UNK* .
p1415
aVSubject : Aviation sector Can the European Council *UNK* what new measures it intends to pursue to improve passenger safety on European airlines in light of the ongoing threat of international terrorism ?
p1416
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1417
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , Regulation ( EC ) No *UNK* of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security represents the Community 's current legal framework in the area of civil aviation security .
p1418
aVThe Regulation , which was made as a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks , has been in force since January 2003 .
p1419
aVTo correct the problems which emerged in the implementation of this Regulation , the Commission put forward a proposal in September 2005 to replace the Regulation with a new one .
p1420
aVIn March of this year the Council adopted a general approach on the Commission proposal .
p1421
aVIn June the European Parliament adopted its position at first reading , which contained *UNK* amendments .
p1422
aVOn the basis of this , the Council achieved political consensus on the proposal on 12 October .
p1423
aVThe adopted text is to be formally reinforced as a common position in a future Council session and submitted to the European Parliament , so that consensus can be *UNK* reached at second reading .
p1424
aVIn consideration of the security problems experienced by the United Kingdom in August this year , the Council hopes that the institutions will reach consensus on the new Regulation as quickly as possible .
p1425
aVThe impact of the new security measures recently introduced by the Commission and its committee for civil aviation security should , in addition , be monitored *UNK* .
p1426
aVIs the Council satisfied that there is enough cooperation between EU Member States in the fight against international terrorism ?
p1427
aVDo you agree that Europol and the EU *UNK* Office are being adequately funded ?
p1428
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1429
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , naturally we can always improve our efforts in the fight against terrorism .
p1430
aVA lot of measures have of course been taken , especially in recent years , but there is always definitely room for improvement .
p1431
aV( LT ) Madam President-in-Office of the Council , most of us arrive here by air .
p1432
aVI can not remember even one case over recent years when aircraft were not delayed by a *UNK* or an hour .
p1433
aV*UNK* , the reason given is security issues .
p1434
aVCould the reason be - and perhaps this really is the case - *UNK* organised and *UNK* work ?
p1435
aVWill we still be able to verify whether security requirements are truly being applied after adoption of this document ?
p1436
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1437
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , as well as decision-making it is obviously very important that we monitor implementation and also *UNK* monitor changes in the operational environment .
p1438
aVIt is also vital , of course , that we are able to establish identical rules for different airports and different Member States .
p1439
aVObviously , good *UNK* will definitely enable us in everyday practical circumstances to tell *UNK* how much time security checks , for example , will take up and thereby reduce the amount of *UNK* caused to passengers .
p1440
aVI nevertheless think that we who travel very regularly also need to get used to the fact that air travel has become a more *UNK* occupation than before .
p1441
aV( DE ) Madam President-in-Office of the Council , I would like - in my capacity as rapporteur on the extension of the powers of the European *UNK* Safety Agency - to report to you that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has , with reference to this subject , also discussed the possibility of *UNK* the *UNK* with security functions .
p1442
aVI would be interested to know what the Presidency of the Council thinks about that idea .
p1443
aVNow for my second question .
p1444
aV*UNK* that has struck me personally is that the privatisation of security checks at airports has had the consequence that these are less able to deal with extreme situations than , for example , the police .
p1445
aVWould it not make sense to reverse this privatisation and have security checks carried out once more by state agencies ?
p1446
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1447
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , obviously it is good for the Council to look at and discuss , for example , how the work of the European Aviation Safety Agency needs to be made more effective , but of course powers and *UNK* can only be transferred to it to the extent that the Member States say they are willing to endorse that .
p1448
aVI find it very hard to believe that the speed of a security check should depend on whether we are dealing with a private *UNK* or a state institution .
p1449
aVThe question is more about *UNK* resources and how much there is in the way of resources generally .
p1450
aVIt is obvious that airports , especially at *UNK* times , must have problems *UNK* with large numbers of passengers .
p1451
aVSubject : The status of the Irish language The Irish language becomes an official working language of the EU institutions on 1 January 2007 .
p1452
aVCan the European Council make a comprehensive statement as to the preparations that have been put in place to guarantee that the EU institutions will have all the necessary systems in place so as to ensure that the Irish language becomes , in practice , an official working language of the European Union on 1 January next ?
p1453
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .

aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , at the request of the Irish Government , the Council *UNK* the rules on language in June 2005 and added the Irish language to the list of official and working languages of the European Union institutions .
p1455
aVThe Council decided that the institutions would not have to draft all legal provisions in Irish or *UNK* them in this language in the Official *UNK* of the European Union .
p1456
aVThis decision is therefore a *UNK* from the rules .
p1457
aVIt will remain in force for five years and that period may be renewed .
p1458
aVIt was also decided that the derogation would not apply to the regulations made in the codecision procedure .
p1459
aVIn accordance with the decision to add Irish to the list of working languages , the Council has taken all the necessary practical steps to ensure that there is due implementation of the decisions as from 1 January 2007 , when the Regulation comes into force .
p1460
aVI thank the President-in-Office for her reply .
p1461
aVCan I take it that , apart from the derogation mentioned , the Irish language will be given equal treatment with all other languages of this Parliament ?
p1462
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1463
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , as I said , the Irish language has been added to the list of the official and working languages of the European Union on the strength of the derogation which I have just referred to .
p1464
aVParliament will itself also have the right to decide how it will in practice implement this .
p1465
aVWhen I said , however , that the Council has taken all the necessary steps to implement the decision , that refers to many *UNK* of practical issues and in my first answer I did not want to describe in detail everything that will be taking place there , but everything that this decision requires .
p1466
aV- ( LT ) I have a question for Mrs *UNK* concerning the future ; while having 21 official languages in the European Union does , of course , reflect our *UNK* national diversity , it is , on the other hand , becoming *UNK* and increasingly complex .
p1467
aVWhat do the Council and the country holding the Presidency think about the future ?
p1468
aVWill this *UNK* continue to *UNK* or will some measures perhaps be applied to simplify *UNK* procedures ?
p1469
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1470
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , as the honourable Member says , linguistic diversity is central to European culture and the pluralism of European *UNK* .
p1471
aVIt has to be *UNK* , however , that for practical reasons and reasons of costs , the Council , where it concerns informal meetings , has more limited arrangements for languages or *UNK* and there are sometimes just two , *UNK* five or six , languages used .
p1472
aVIn fact the system has worked very well in practice .
p1473
aVSubject : *UNK* up of press *UNK* in China The Chinese authorities have recently imposed *UNK* *UNK* on the foreign press , making it subject to strict internal rules .
p1474
aV*UNK* *UNK* by foreign press agencies is first to be checked and , if *UNK* necessary , *UNK* , the new rules explicitly state , in order not to *UNK* the stability , national unity and sovereignty of the country .
p1475
aVThis is yet another instance of violation of human rights .
p1476
aVThe Commission has already *UNK* its concern and intends to raise the issue in future contacts with China .
p1477
aVWill the Council be doing the same , and what measures does it propose to take against this totally *UNK* press *UNK* ?
p1478
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1479
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , like the honourable Member , the Council is worried about *UNK* press *UNK* in China .
p1480
aVAt all the *UNK* of the *UNK* human rights dialogue held twice a year , the European Union has systematically and repeatedly *UNK* China to ratify the International *UNK* on Civil and *UNK* Rights , which contains rules on freedom of expression .
p1481
aVIt has also encouraged China to *UNK* travel restrictions on foreign journalists and made other demands that relate to *UNK* Chinese citizens .
p1482
aVThis issue was raised at the round of talks on 19 October in Beijing as part of the *UNK* human rights dialogue .
p1483
aV( NL ) Madam President , Madam President-in-Office of the Council , when the freedom of the press is *UNK* in some poor African country , then the Council is the first to denounce this in the *UNK* terms and to threaten sanctions .
p1484
aVWhen it happens in China , people simply express their concern .
p1485
aVThis has all the *UNK* of double standards .
p1486
aVMy question is specifically : will the violation of the freedom of press in China once again feature on the agenda at the next *UNK* summit ?
p1487
aVSecondly , what specific measures will you be taking in order to actually demand that China 's freedom of press and human rights in general be upheld ?
p1488
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1489
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , the Foreign Ministers of the country to hold the presidency and China met at the *UNK* Summit in Helsinki on 10 September .
p1490
aVAt the time the matter of freedom of the press was in the *UNK* and the discussions between the Foreign Ministers devoted much time to this .
p1491
aVWe might therefore say that the European Union 's reaction is just as swift as when it talks to other countries , and in a similar *UNK* .
p1492
aVAt the start of September , there was a summit meeting held between the European Union and China and at this meeting the question of human rights was also discussed generally .
p1493
aVSubject : EU Fundamental Rights Agency Can the European Council make a statement as to the state of progress on setting up the new EU Fundamental Rights Agency , and could it specify the likely powers that this agency will have ?
p1494
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1495
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , at its meeting in June 2006 the European Council welcomed the progress that had been made in talks relating to the proposal put forward by the Commission in July last year for a Regulation establishing a European Agency for Fundamental Rights and a proposal for a Council decision *UNK* the European Agency for Fundamental Rights to pursue its activities in areas referred to under the third pillar in the Treaty on European Union , which is to say cooperation on justice and home affairs .
p1496
aVThe European Council asked for the necessary measures to be implemented as soon as possible , so that the Agency could be set up and so that it could start operations on 1 January 2007 .
p1497
aVIn accordance with the European Council conclusions , the *UNK* Presidency held a number of bilateral meetings in July , August , September and October with the aim of resolving the main question still *UNK* , namely extending the work of the Agency to areas covered by the third pillar in the Treaty on European Union .
p1498
aVAt a Council session in early October the Presidency presented a review of the talks that had been held and asked for support for the idea of extending the work of the Agency to areas covered by the third pillar in the Treaty on European Union , but in a more restricted *UNK* than in the Commission 's original proposal .
p1499
aVThe majority of the delegations that presented their view supported this approach by the Presidency , although some *UNK* whether a proper legal basis for the move would be found .
p1500
aVThe Presidency is continuing to look at the options and will put forward an interim proposal to the delegations in the near future .
p1501
aVAs regards the Agency 's competence , the aim of the Agency is to provide advice and *UNK* on fundamental rights to Community institutions , bodies and agencies when they are applying Community law , and in this way help them guarantee a respect for fundamental rights when they implement measures or determine policy within the context of their competences .
p1502
aVThere is general consensus that establishing such an agency would create added value for EU policy on human rights and increase its coherence .
p1503
aVThe Agency will also be the main point of contact in the European Union for matters relating to fundamental rights .
p1504
aVIt will discharge its duties , *UNK* the work of the Council of Europe and in *UNK* with it , if the decisions on establishing it are taken .
p1505
aVThe points you have raised reflect the concern that many of us in Parliament have that , once we propose this agency , the initial role we had envisaged for it will be *UNK* until it ends up as a *UNK* or a contact point that would merely be distributing information from one Member State to another , rather than taking a leading role in defending fundamental rights .
p1506
aV*UNK* you could *UNK* us as to whether that is a true interpretation of what you have been *UNK* concerning the bilateral meetings .
p1507
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1508
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , first it has to be said that it is intended that this Agency should be an *UNK* , expert body .
p1509
aVWe also of course believe , however , that it would be difficult to justify to our citizens the establishment of a Fundamental Rights Agency which would be denied the right to exercise the key competences necessary to do its job and undertake action under the third pillar .
p1510
aVAccordingly , the work on this issue continues .
p1511
aVIt seems to me that the Member States are *UNK* their way through to creating an agency that will not have within its responsibilities the very subject area where EU action is most likely to cause problems with regard to human rights .
p1512
aVI have a further question : does the Council not agree that we seem to be creating more and more agencies , like *UNK* *UNK* around the Member States , so that everybody has one , rather than when there is a real need - not so much this one , perhaps , but many of the others that have been created ?
p1513
aVAll of them have a *UNK* structure with a management board with representation from every Member State and an administration that is sometimes smaller than the management board .
p1514
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1515
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , perhaps there is an aim sometimes and in some *UNK* to do this .
p1516
aVAs the country to hold the presidency , however , we have tried to aim for an administrative structure that is as light as possible .
p1517
aVWith regard to the Fundamental Rights Agency , however , as I said at the start , there is positive consensus that it is necessary .
p1518
aVAccordingly , we have to work hard to ensure that the decisions are taken , that the Agency can start to function as from 1 January , and that it has competence in key areas of its operation .
p1519
aVSubject : *UNK* Iranian relations Can the European Council make a statement on the present state of play with regard to *UNK* relations , addressing in particular the issue of the future of the nuclear industry in Iran ?
p1520
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1521
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , the Council is committed to doing more to build long-term relations with Iran based on trust and cooperation .
p1522
aV*UNK* relations will mean progress in all the problematic issues , among which are human rights , terrorism , Iran 's attitude to the peace process in the Middle East and local matters there , and Iran 's nuclear programme .
p1523
aVIn the matter of Iran 's nuclear industry , the Council has many a time said it was committed to a diplomatic solution , which would take account of the international concern about Iran 's nuclear programme , but at the same time confirms Iran 's right to the peaceful *UNK* of nuclear power in accordance with the *UNK* *UNK* Treaty .
p1524
aVRegarding this , the Council stated on 17 October that it greatly *UNK* the *UNK* with which High Representative *UNK* Solana has since June encouraged Iran to respond to the demands of the International *UNK* Energy Agency 's governing board and the UN Security Council and continued talks on long-term arrangements .
p1525
aVThe EU views seriously the *UNK* 's evaluation that it has not been able to make any progress in almost four years of continued close monitoring in its efforts to confirm the *UNK* and scope of Iran 's *UNK* regarding the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme .
p1526
aVThe EU is also very worried that Iran has not ended all its *UNK* *UNK* and *UNK* activities , as the *UNK* 's governing board and the UN Security Council have asked .
p1527
aVThe Security Council stated in its Resolution *UNK* that it intended to implement relevant measures under Article *UNK* unless Iran complied with the demand .
p1528
aVThe Council accordingly is of the opinion that , if Iran continues its *UNK* *UNK* activities , the Union will have no other alternative but to back talks on these sanctions .
p1529
aVThe Council this month stated that the door to the negotiating chamber was still open for Iran , and *UNK* the country strongly to *UNK* for the positive approach that had been proposed for it .
p1530
aVThe EU 's High Representative put forward to Iran on 6 June proposals drawn up by six countries .
p1531
aVThese far-reaching proposals would form a basis for a long-term agreement and would give Iran everything it needs to develop its current civil nuclear energy sector , and they also take account of international concerns .
p1532
aV*UNK* for this positive approach would prepare the way for new relations with Iran , which could be based on mutual respect and extended cooperation in politics and economic matters .
p1533
aVThe Council hopes that progress can be made along this *UNK* path .
p1534
aVI can see that you are trying to have *UNK* measures between Europe and Iran , to try to better relations between the two of them and act as *UNK* *UNK* in this serious situation ; but the idea of sanctions does not really work .
p1535
aVIt did not work in Iraq and it is not going to work in Iran .
p1536
aVIt is quite a wealthy , *UNK* country and they will just carry on .
p1537
aVIt may affect them somewhat , but it is not going to affect them that much in the long run .
p1538
aVThere are certain issues that you touched on yourself .
p1539
aVOne of these is the *UNK* of *UNK* out of Afghanistan through Iran , and considering that there are about three million *UNK* *UNK* in Iran and they have lost about *UNK* troops on the border trying to stop this going on ... ( The President cut off the speaker ) President-in-Office of the Council .
p1540
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , the discussion on possible sanctions obviously relates to the fact that the UN Security Council 's Resolution *UNK* is something the European Union is also committed to .
p1541
aV*UNK* trafficking is linked to the general situation in Afghanistan , which could even be the topic of a separate question .
p1542
aVThe Union is committed long-term to the *UNK* development of Afghanistan , as well as the *UNK* operation and crisis management in that country , so that the production of *UNK* is kept in check there .
p1543
aVSubject : EU facilitation for trade as a *UNK* measure between *UNK* and *UNK* In my report on *UNK* Trade and Economic *UNK* , I called on *UNK* *UNK* and *UNK* to further reduce administrative *UNK* to implementing *UNK* *UNK* measures and for the EU to offer technical assistance , if required , in this regard ' .
p1544
aVSimilarly , Council Regulation ( EEC ) No *UNK* highlights regional cooperation as a *UNK* area ' for assistance and an important sector for economic cooperation .
p1545
aVWhat role does the Council believe trade could play in bringing *UNK* and *UNK* closer to a peaceful resolution of the *UNK* question ?
p1546
aV*UNK* this issue discussed at the recent *UNK* Summit in Helsinki and what conclusions were reached ?
p1547
aVCould the Council *UNK* any programmes , or proposals for programmes , that would support *UNK* *UNK* measures between *UNK* and *UNK* , with specific reference to *UNK* and *UNK* reconstruction , as well as supporting closer economic integration in *UNK* in general ?
p1548
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1549
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , the Council agrees that trade could have major significance in bringing *UNK* and *UNK* closer together .
p1550
aVIn its conclusions in February 2004 the Council repeated that it supported efforts to promote regional cooperation within the framework of the South *UNK* Association for Regional Cooperation ( *UNK* ) and especially the agreement on establishing a free trade zone in South Asia by the year 2006 .
p1551
aVThe EU is pleased with the recently signed South Asia Free Trade Agreement ( *UNK* ) , but *UNK* that some Member States of *UNK* still have *UNK* bilateral issues .
p1552
aV*UNK* these would give the Member States of the Association the opportunity to *UNK* full benefit from the agreements they are *UNK* to .
p1553
aV*UNK* speaking , the EU still supports all the efforts being made to facilitate trade in multilateral *UNK* as they are an important way to strengthen trade and investment links between the different countries .
p1554
aVThe decision by the *UNK* ministerial *UNK* to *UNK* on the EU the role of *UNK* is a splendid opportunity to develop cooperation between *UNK* and the EU .
p1555
aVCooperation between the two was discussed at the *UNK* *UNK* Summit in Helsinki on 13 October .
p1556
aVThe EU wants to improve the practical support it gives to *UNK* .
p1557
aVThe Commission has already drafted a programme on economic cooperation with *UNK* .
p1558
aVThe programme covers facilitation of trade , standards and cooperation between new businesses .
p1559
aVThe aim is to promote trade within the region by *UNK* the implementation of *UNK* , and this , it is hoped , will provide the impetus for improved political relations in the region .
p1560
aVThe *UNK* *UNK* and the Member States of the EU intend to adopt this programme in the near future .
p1561
aVThe Union is encouraging broad dialogue between *UNK* and *UNK* and hopes that trading and other relations will develop *UNK* , because that would promote stability in the whole region .
p1562
aVWe welcome the fact that there have been moves to increase trust between *UNK* and *UNK* recently , as a result of which *UNK* contacts between people , direct bus and train connections and visits by members of parliament and *UNK* *UNK* have become possible .
p1563
aVThe *UNK* and *UNK* *UNK* met in *UNK* this September .
p1564
aV*UNK* between the two countries were discussed at general level at a summit meeting held on 13 October .
p1565
aVFirst of all I would like to thank the Council Presidency for the very detailed response to the question I tabled .
p1566
aVI would , however , like one further specific *UNK* of information .
p1567
aVThis goes back to my original question as to whether the particular issue in relation to *UNK* and *UNK* was actually specifically discussed at the EU Summit with *UNK* in Helsinki .
p1568
aVThe reason I ask that is because both those nations are having detailed discussions at Foreign Secretary level on 14 and 15 November .
p1569
aVIs there a specific message to them from the Council ?
p1570
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1571
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , I was indeed present most of the time at this summit , but I do not remember how the *UNK* question arose .
p1572
aVI have had it confirmed to me , however , that this question was touched upon as part of the issue of regional stability and the situation in the region .
p1573
aV( LT ) Madam President-in-Office , I have a question in relation to next week 's visit of the delegation of the European Parliament to *UNK* by *UNK* of the *UNK* government .
p1574
aVWhat do you think the major states , primarily the United States and Russia , contribute to solving the problem of *UNK* and what else could the European Union do in this context ?
p1575
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1576
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , regarding this question , as with many others that have been raised in this Chamber today , it has to be said that , as it concerns an issue between the two countries , it is essential that the parties themselves actively seek a solution .
p1577
aVThe Union and the other great powers can indeed support this process .
p1578
aVAs , however , I am *UNK* questions here mainly on behalf of the Council , it is impossible for me to take a very strong view on behalf of the United States of America .
p1579
aVSubject : Labour *UNK* and violation of workers ' rights In July 2006 the Italian police , in cooperation with *UNK* law enforcement authorities , closed down labour *UNK* in southern Italy in which *UNK* workers were being kept by Italian employers under conditions which failed to meet basic health and hygiene standards or comply with basic labour law in Italy .
p1580
aVFurther investigations have *UNK* that this was not an isolated example and that workers in other regions of Italy and other EU Member States have encountered similar practices ( failure to respect labour law provisions ) Will the Council take action to *UNK* those responsible for this breach of workers ' rights and will it take effective measures to prevent the establishment of such labour *UNK* within EU territory in future ?
p1581
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1582
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , the honourable Member raises an important issue in this question .
p1583
aVThe Council , and the Council since the amendments made to the Treaty , together with the European Parliament have delivered an extensive Community code in the area of safety and security at work .
p1584
aVThe Member States are responsible for implementing this code .
p1585
aVThe Council welcomes the fact that in the case referred to in the honourable Member 's question , the Italian and *UNK* law enforcement agencies *UNK* to close down the work *UNK* referred to .
p1586
aVAlthough we , like the honourable Member , are concerned about this , it has to be said that responsibility for *UNK* implementation of Community legislation in the Member States lies with the Commission , not the Council .
p1587
aV( PL ) Madam President , I have a question for the Presidency .
p1588
aVWould it not be possible to *UNK* mechanisms , perhaps through *UNK* , that would facilitate the creation of a special monitoring *UNK* , particularly in cases of *UNK* cooperation between local authorities , and even local police , and the *UNK* of criminal activities , such as the labour *UNK* for citizens of Central and Eastern Europe ?
p1589
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1590
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , the Community code that exists for this sector and the secondary legislation that has been added to it demands a guarantee of equal treatment of nationals of other Member States with regard to working conditions .
p1591
aVIt is a question of monitoring it , which is the task of the Member States ' own authorities .
p1592
aVIn accordance with the principles of the rule of law and good governance , in the Union we have to expect these *UNK* bodies also to act in accordance with the regulations , and insist on it .
p1593
aV- ( LT ) Mrs *UNK* , I would like to ask whether such *UNK* in fact create a source of *UNK* for the free movement of persons .
p1594
aVThis is the situation the old Member States were in after the introduction of a transitional period for the new ones .
p1595
aVBy applying such a transitional period in Romania and Bulgaria , is it not encouraging illegal work ?
p1596
aVPresident-in-Office of the Council .
p1597
aV( *UNK* ) Madam President , the Member States take decisions on whether to apply transition periods for new Member States regarding the free movement of the workforce .
p1598
aVThere were also Member States which applied a period of transition in the previous round of enlargement , but no longer do so in this new round .
p1599
aVThe reason is the *UNK* that it is still better for a workforce to move within the framework of common European rules than create arrangements for *UNK* .
p1600
aVAs I said in my answer to a previous question , equal treatment of the workforce is very well regulated , but of course we have to pay more and more attention to implementation and supervision .
p1601
aV( DE ) Madam President , my criticism is not directed at you , for I hold the way you run *UNK* *UNK* in high regard , but I really would like you to cast your mind back to Monday , when we determined the order in which business was to be conducted this week .
p1602
aVThe Conference of Presidents envisaged that *UNK* *UNK* would last one and a half hours ; then the President reduced it to an hour .
p1603
aVSeveral Members *UNK* at this , and there was no vote on it , and so I have worked on the *UNK* that we have available to us for *UNK* *UNK* the hour and a half that we are rightly due .
p1604
aVI would like to ask whether the Council might remain for another quarter of an hour or *UNK* minutes , or is there a trade union for Council presidencies that *UNK* them from *UNK* questions after seven in the evening ?
p1605
aV*UNK* to the Council used to begin after 9 *UNK* , and that worked like a *UNK* , with the Council *UNK* until the following day .
p1606
aVTo sum up , I think there is something wrong with this way of going about things .
p1607
aVMr Posselt , much as I am delighted by your *UNK* , you are wrong about our debate on Monday , since it concerned the agenda rather than the Rules of Procedure , and it was the agenda that was the subject of a vote .
p1608
aVYou can check that again in the Minutes .
p1609
aVWe should all take *UNK* *UNK* seriously - or more seriously than we do - as an important *UNK* of Members , and we should all work together to ensure that it is not *UNK* from the agenda too frequently .
p1610
aV*UNK* which had not been *UNK* for lack of time would receive written answers ( see Annex ) .
p1611
aVThat concludes *UNK* *UNK* .

aV( The sitting was suspended at *UNK* *UNK* and resumed at *UNK* p.m. ) 2 .
